I would love it if I could get my Ambassadors from the region confirmed. If you could talk to your colleagues on the Senate side, that would be most helpful to us in executing American policy.    But I am convinced that we will have the resources we need to deliver all of the assistance to build out the Iraqi security forces in a way to give the Iraqi leaders--the speaker of the house will be here this week; I will get a chance to meet with him again--to deliver all the support needed, so that Iraq can become independent, free, and sovereign.

       "2  Look, I am proud of what this Administration has done in Iraq. I think we have been prepared to do things, take risks, act against Iran, the true malign actor inside of Iraq today, in ways the previous Administration just had no interest in whatsoever. So, I am very proud of the work we have done there.    I have traveled now to Baghdad as the Secretary. I had been there before in my previous role. I have senior officials on the ground. I would love it if I could get my Ambassadors from the region confirmed. If you could talk to your colleagues on the Senate side, that would be most helpful to us in executing American policy.    But I am convinced that we will have the resources we need to deliver all of the assistance to build out the Iraqi security forces in a way to give the Iraqi leaders--the speaker of the house will be here this week; I will get a chance to meet with him again--to deliver all the support needed, so that Iraq can become independent, free, and sovereign. I think that is your goal. It is certainly mine.   \n",

The Fiscal Year foreign affairs budget eliminates all economic assistance to the Syrian people and all security assistance, known as foreign military financing. That is to Iraq. Since the re-emergence of ISIS, Iraq used FMF to fund urgent counterterrorism requirements, and the State Department claimed those funds were critical to Iraq's efforts to defeat ISIS and improve the security environment in Iraq.    Given these statements by the State Department, why the decision to cut FMF when it seems, based on those statements, that it would undermine efforts in Iraq, our efforts in Iraq, and create the conditions that would allow ISIS to revive?   \n",
