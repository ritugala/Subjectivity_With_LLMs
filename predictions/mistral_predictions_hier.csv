I thought you would. But nonetheless, I agree with all that you have said. It has been a very important, effective program. I am a continuing improvement guy; can we improve maybe the delivery and the processes and the protocols there. Yes, we have some disparity between our states of how they are implementing and executing that, and the cost over delivery, and I would like to see more unanimity in some of those delivery mechanisms, learning from the best, learning from one another about how we can deliver those programs even better. But as far as I am concerned, we have no proposed changes. You don't try to fix things that aren't broken.

Sometimes, I guess, the saying we have in Georgia, ``When the mule is out the gate, it is too late to close the gate.'' You don't get that opportunity after an outbreak has occurred. You all are wise in considering a vaccine bank, whether it is foot-and-mouth disease, whether it is High-Path Avian Influenza.    I will comment on the fact that while the 2015 outbreak of High-Path we were a little slow to respond, both at the state and probably the Federal level, the outbreak that we have had in Tennessee and north Alabama this year, I was very, very impressed with the process there. The biosanitary processes and protocols that our producers have learned, the depopulation, in the speed with which USDA moved over the indemnification issues, and there was no confusion there. To their credit, that was confined very, very tightly. And that is the best kind of insurance we can have, although this Committee and Congress is very wise to consider a foot-and-mouth disease bank, maybe High-Path AI as well, because of the damage to the market psychologically. What happens whenever we have any of these outbreaks, you go back to BSE almost 15 years ago or longer, that is how long it has taken us to get beef back into some nations there. It damages the market, not just for that period of time, but it gives people a loss of confidence in our reputation of safety in the U.S.    We know that vaccination is effective, and you are wise to consider those efforts.",100000,110000,['answer'],"The witness is providing a direct answer to the question, addressing all aspects of it and giving a detailed response","['direct', 'overanswer']","; A direct answer that provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the witness's viewpoint, versus an overanswer that might provide more information than what was asked for."

26,11525545055,Would it be your belief that the unsubsidized premium for crop insurance should reflect the risk?,"Again, any valid insurance program, whether it is crop insurance or any other insurance program, has to reflect the reality of risk there. That is what insurance is all about. As I said, as we continue to perfect the insurance program, because I agree with you, and as you well know, credit in these economic times is getting more tight, lenders are requiring an insurance product, maybe forward contracting as well, so that the producers can demonstrate repayment ability. And as we go through there, yes, I agree that it ought to be commensurate with risk. That is a tough issue, how do we do that individually, or by county or by region, in a way to do that. That is why reporting is so important for our farmers. The Census is so important for our farmers and producers to make sure we have accurate data that we can make good, wise actuarial decisions on.",100000,110000,['answer'],The witness is providing an answer to the question,"['direct', 'overanswer']","; An annotator could interpret the response as directly answering the question, or providing additional information to provide context to the question."
27,11388494029,Can you explain that?,"Part of the process when this started, because there are literally millions of emails, was to take a look at, in agreement with the staffs of the investigating committees, take a look at 83, ultimately it was originally a smaller number, the IRS added to the custodians as it were, that is, the people sending and receiving emails, there are 83 of those that we agreed to look at. The terms in terms of what would be relevant were determined by congressional committees, as well as the IRS, to try to limit the volume. As I say, limiting the volume, you still have 700,000 pages of relevant documents. To the extent that somebody wants to look at hundreds of thousands more pages of what the search terms defined by the Congress would be termed irrelevant, at some point we are happy to provide those. We will provide those in the orderly course.    But I will tell you that our experience is it is going to be an overwhelming volume of materials. They will take us some significant time to redact taxpayer information, a significant part of which will have nothing to do with this investigation. But if that is the way the committee wants to go, we will go that way. But the other committees, and staff of this committee in the early determinations, decided that that would be a fruitless task of overwhelming the investigators, not us, overwhelming the investigators with thousands of pages of irrelevant documents. Therefore, they suggested with us and selected with us search terms of what would be relevant: Tea Party, examinations, whatever else they picked. There are a whole series of those terms designed to limit the volume of materials.    We still have provided a lot of duplicative and probably irrelevant materials within those search terms, but we have not determined anything within those search terms. We have said if those are the terms that will help you winnow it down, we are happy to work with you. But if the committee wants to get simply large volumes of personal emails from a lot of different people, we will go through again, making sure that we redact those appropriately. As I say, we have provided unredacted copies of all of this in terms of the relevance determined by the committees to the other committees, and we provided all of the redacted information available now and we are continue to redact it. It cannot be done overnight.",100000,111100,"['answer', 'shift']","The witness is attempting to clarify the question, and then shift the conversation to a different topic","['direct', 'overanswer', 'dodge', 'correct']","; An annotator might interpret this answer as being direct and providing a detailed explanation of the process or they might interpret it as being overly verbose and irrelevant to the question; An annotator interprets the response as a dodge if it does not provide a direct answer or if it changes the subject, or as a correct if it provides a relevant and accurate response that answers the question"

30,11388494039,Can you please explain how this expedited review process worked?,"The way that worked is Interim Commissioner Danny Werfel, who I think did a great job as the interim, established a process for expedited review, and any applicant who would simply certify that they were not going to spend more than 40 percent of their time on political activity could be approved immediately. And that streamlined process continues for new applicants. Forty-five or so of the existing at that time pending applicants filed that paper and were immediately reviewed and approved. Of those that are still pending, they have decided not to, in fact, sign the affidavit that they would not spend more than 40 percent of their time on political activity.",100000,100000,['answer'],The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the expedited review process and how it worked.,['direct'],; The witness provides a direct answer to the question

We have an awesome opportunity in this country as abundant food suppliers for the world, and that doesn't exclude our American citizens too who have less opportunity for food safety and food nutrition. But the fact is that whether it is the P.L. 83-480 program, Food for Peace, McGovern-Dole, or others, I hope that we can see these programs sustained and be able to use the bountiful production of our American producers in order to be a weapon for peace around the world.",110000,110000,['answer'],The witness is providing a response to the question,"['direct', 'overanswer']","; A witness may answer the question directly and provide a comprehensive answer, or they may provide more information than necessary, which is not the intent of the question"

Food banks, one of the things we can do in food banks is develop a wonderful, progressive food waste program where many of these foods we ought to be ashamed as a nation over our waste of some products, while some people go hungry.

75,11525545000,Could you walk us through your vision of that?,"Certainly, I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman. Before I get into the answer to that question, you and I have had conversations. I was very pleased that the National Cotton Council came up with a very innovative and creative budget-neutral idea over their program, and it is very disappointing that we were not able to get that done, but we can look for its resolution in the 2018 Farm Bill as you indicated.    Certainly, as I went around visiting, I visited with really 3/4, 75 of your Members on the other side of the House, and trade was on all of their minds really because we are fortunate to live in a nation where we can grow more than we can consume, and that is the essence of trade; doing what we do well, and also it is a noble endeavor to feed the world. Our new motto for USDA is, ``Do right and feed everyone.'' And that is what we want to do; we want to feed the hungry here in the United States, but we want to feed the hungry around the world. And our producers and ranchers have demonstrated a capacity to share and to do that. That is what trade is all about.    In the 2014 Farm Bill you all recognized that, and suggested very strongly for an Under Secretary for Trade. I happen to agree with you. It was not an easy thing to do. There were several components that had to come together, and we are working through those details right now. But we felt it was important because trade was almost number one on everyone's mind that I spoke with, internally, externally, in the Senate, and for those of you who commented as well. We have to sell our way out of this supply/demand situation that are depressing prices in the U.S. now, and that is what we hope to do.    We have seen some early successes of that, and we will continue. The fact is, my opinion is that people do business with people, and I want someone every day that woke up with that on their mind: where can I go to sell United States agricultural products around the world, who is hungry, who will buy, how can we do the deal. Now, our role at USDA is to provide the expertise, the content, to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross, and to our new Trade Representative, Mr. Lighthizer, in order to be a triumvirate of sales. The Secretary of Commerce has a broader portfolio than we do at USDA. But that is the blending of trade; you do what you do well, and we sell you what we do well.    I have been very impressed with Secretary Ross and his really sinking his teeth into ag issues and ag products there, and we are very pleased with the progress that we have made so far.    We believe the Secretary of Trade will be on everyone's front door as often as can be. This guy is going to be a million mile flyer around the world to be there in person, because we know that foreign interests love to see you in person. It is an honor for them, for us to come to their doorstep, and call on them and say here is my card, we want to do the deal. And that is important. We can do conference calls, we can do videos, but the presence is important. That person could not do that when they were also charged with the Farm Service Agency of having all these multiple offices around the country dealing with those customer-facing issues every day. I felt very strongly that the segregation of that; having an Under Secretary for Trade, was vitally important to get the job done of selling these bountiful products.",100000,100000,['vision'],The witness is providing a detailed explanation of his vision or understanding of the topic,['direct'],; The witness is providing a clear and direct answer to the question and sharing their vision of what they believe should be done
