0,11495063129,What is your definition of a small business?,"For my definition of a small business, I rely on the Small Business Administration. They define it for us and the entire Federal Government. And it varies industry to industry.",101000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
1,11386195154,The Inspector General determined that Ms. Lerner learned about the inappropriate screening criteria in June of 2011. That was 6 months after you moved to your full-time ACA position. Is that right?,"I understand that is the timing, yes, sir.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
2,11635589127,"And we have. And you are the Secretary of State before us. And as a former Member of this body, you also understand the constitutional obligation we have to provide oversight of the Administration.    The Fiscal Year foreign affairs budget eliminates all economic assistance to the Syrian people and all security assistance, known as foreign military financing. That is to Iraq. Since the re-emergence of ISIS, Iraq used FMF to fund urgent counterterrorism requirements, and the State Department claimed those funds were critical to Iraq's efforts to defeat ISIS and improve the security environment in Iraq.    Given these statements by the State Department, why the decision to cut FMF when it seems, based on those statements, that it would undermine efforts in Iraq, our efforts in Iraq, and create the conditions that would allow ISIS to revive?","Look, I am proud of what this Administration has done in Iraq. I think we have been prepared to do things, take risks, act against Iran, the true malign actor inside of Iraq today, in ways the previous Administration just had no interest in whatsoever. So, I am very proud of the work we have done there.    I have traveled now to Baghdad as the Secretary. I had been there before in my previous role. I have senior officials on the ground. I would love it if I could get my Ambassadors from the region confirmed. If you could talk to your colleagues on the Senate side, that would be most helpful to us in executing American policy.    But I am convinced that we will have the resources we need to deliver all of the assistance to build out the Iraqi security forces in a way to give the Iraqi leaders--the speaker of the house will be here this week; I will get a chance to meet with him again--to deliver all the support needed, so that Iraq can become independent, free, and sovereign. I think that is your goal. It is certainly mine.",001000,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
3,11635230123,"My question is, given all those connections, is it likely that Donald Trump was fully aware and had every intent of working with Russia to help make sure that he could win the Presidency at all costs?","So let me say that this is a matter that's currently being handled by the House Select and the Senate Select Intelligence Committees, as I would rather not answer that specific question, other than just to tell you that Mr. Trump's desire to win would have him work with anyone.    And one other thing that I had said in my statement is that when it came to the Trump Tower Moscow project, it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and we never expected to win the election. So this was just business as usual.",000101,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no
4,11637282057,"Right. So did you verbally counsel Ms. Conway, ``Hey, you're crossing a line, don't do that''?","I have never spoken to Ms. Conway. But the White House Counsel's Office gave her numerous trainings, in fact, some that our career staff sent over there, PowerPoints and other training materials on the Hatch Act, and specifically on using her official authority to influence an election, specifically on this violation.",100000,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
