11635589127,"And we have. And you are the Secretary of State before us. And as a former Member of this body, you also understand the constitutional obligation we have to provide oversight of the Administration.    The Fiscal Year foreign affairs budget eliminates all economic assistance to the Syrian people and all security assistance, known as foreign military financing. That is to Iraq. Since the re-emergence of ISIS, Iraq used FMF to fund urgent counterterrorism requirements, and the State Department claimed those funds were critical to Iraq's efforts to defeat ISIS and improve the security environment in Iraq.    Given these statements by the State Department, why the decision to cut FMF when it seems, based on those statements, that it would undermine efforts in Iraq, our efforts in Iraq, and create the conditions that would allow ISIS to revive?","Look, I am proud of what this Administration has done in Iraq. I think we have been prepared to do things, take risks, act against Iran, the true malign actor inside of Iraq today, in ways the previous Administration just had no interest in whatsoever. So, I am very proud of the work we have done there.    I have traveled now to Baghdad as the Secretary. I had been there before in my previous role. I have senior officials on the ground. I would love it if I could get my Ambassadors from the region confirmed. If you could talk to your colleagues on the Senate side, that would be most helpful to us in executing American policy.    But I am convinced that we will have the resources we need to deliver all of the assistance to build out the Iraqi security forces in a way to give the Iraqi leaders--the speaker of the house will be here this week; I will get a chance to meet with him again--to deliver all the support needed, so that Iraq can become independent, free, and sovereign.

11635230123,"My question is, given all those connections, is it likely that Donald Trump was fully aware and had every intent of working with Russia to help make sure that he could win the Presidency at all costs?","So let me say that this is a matter that's currently being handled by the House Select and the Senate Select Intelligence Committees, as I would rather not answer that specific question, other than just to tell you that Mr. Trump's desire to win would have him work with anyone.    And one other thing that I had said in my statement is that when it came to the Trump Tower Moscow project, it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and we never expected to win the election. So this was just business as usual.",101,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no
11637282057,"Right. So did you verbally counsel Ms. Conway, ``Hey, you're crossing a line, don't do that''?","I have never spoken to Ms. Conway.

11530956043,"Mr. Zuckerberg, I only have a few more seconds. In November 2017, ProPublica reported that Facebook was still allowing housing advertisements to systemically exclude advertisements to specific racial groups, an explicitly prohibited practice. This is just one example where Facebook has allowed race to improperly play a role.    What has Facebook done, and what are you going to do to ensure that your targeted advertisements and other components of your platform are in compliance with Federal laws, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1968?","Congressman, since we learned about that, we removed the option for advertisers to exclude ethnic groups from targeting.",111000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11531349037,"Thank you.    Chairman Powell, the Fed's median projection is for three interest rate increases in 2018. What would cause you to raise rates more than three times this year? Would you have to see a material increase in inflation, faster GDP growth, higher wage growth? What would cause you to raise rates more?","Thank you, Mrs. Maloney. You are right that every quarter each participant in the FOMC submits a projection of what they feel is going to happen in the economy and also their projection for appropriate monetary policy. At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018.    Now, we will submit another projection, all of us, in 3 weeks. But since then, what we have seen is incoming data that suggests a strengthening in the economy. We have seen continuing strength in the labor market. We have seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target.    We have also seen continued strength around the globe. We have seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate pass as we go into the March meeting, and I wouldn't want to prejudge that.",1100,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

11531349079,"Now, let me ask this question, and I would like to follow up with you on this matter particularly.    But let me ask you this when we just talk about these tax cuts. How much of corporate tax savings do you think will actually go toward wages, as opposed to stock buybacks, capital investments, and mergers?    I say this because I want to just let you know, even before you answer, Morgan Stanley announced it is estimated that 43 percent of corporate tax savings will go to buybacks and dividends, which enriches just the top 1 percent of those major investors; 19 percent would go toward mergers and acquisitions; 17 percent would go toward investments; and only the crumbs, 13 percent, would go to one-time bonuses and scant raises.    In fact, there are nine pharmaceutical companies that have already announced over $50 billion in buybacks since the tax law was passed. How much of these taxes will go into salaries and wages? Or how much of it will really help the income disparity to increase and grow wider?","We have particular responsibilities, maximum employment, stable prices. We don't have estimates of that kind of thing. There are many other estimates out there, but honestly we don't have a Fed estimate for what that number would be.",11,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11635589072,"Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate that.    I would like to move on at this point to Burma. A year and a half ago, the Burmese military drove the Rohingya out of the Rakhine State through a campaign of killings and rapes and burning of villages, and some of the most horrific and unspeakable crimes that we had seen on this globe in a long, long time. We all appreciated when then-Secretary Tillerson, your predecessor, dubbed these atrocities as ethnic cleansing. Now, as you know, ethnic cleansing is a powerful message, but it does not have legal weight.    And since 2017, overwhelming evidence has come out that clearly shows that the Burmese military committed crimes against humanity. Even the Department's own investigation into these atrocities came to similar conclusions. Several entities, including the House, have concluded that these crimes constitute genocide. The State Department has not made any legal pronouncement at this point beyond ethnic cleansing.    Given all the evidence available to you, could you comment today if you are ready to conclude or where you are in determining whether the crimes committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese military did constitute at least crimes against humanity?","Yes, let me try to address that. You referenced the report that the State Department did. It was amazing work by some really talented State Department officers to go out and collect that data. I think the data speaks for itself in terms of the horrific nature of what took place there.    With respect to making this legal determination, I am not prepared to provide you an answer today. Know that we are still looking at it, frankly, that I am still looking at that more specifically. My objective here is to get a really good outcome, to change this behavior, then to hold those responsible accountable. I want to make sure that we do this in a thoughtful way. I get the messaging that takes place when a Secretary of State makes these designations. I value that and it is important. But I think we would all agree the most important thing we can do is get both accountability and behavioral change, and that is what the State Department is working to do. We are still actively considering how to approach those conclusions.",100001,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no
11637282124,"Can she explain why Democrat legislation that fails to take meaningful steps to solve the border crisis offered up while criticizing the people charged with guarding our border in a cynical political game, exploiting the tragedy of migrants dying, while those very same Democrats who denied the crisis refuse to address it and then act like they are the heroes for throwing money at it with no plan at all to deal with it, can she explain why that is flawed legislation?",I just can't really comment on the specific statement.,1,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no

11531504113,"Well, you know, I mentioned the risks of lead in drinking water. So with this new rule--those risks were shown by epidemiological studies that protected the patient confidentiality and all the other intricacies of confidential information. Now your rule would lead to the idea that if it doesn't suit the manufacturers' intent that now those studies could be disregarded.    So do you believe that mesothelioma can, or that asbestos causes mesothelioma?",I do.

11530242066,"My time is almost up and I have one more question and I think it is important. You may not know this, Mr. Smith, but it is actually considered best practices in a company with lots of sensitive, personal information to have their chief information security officer have independent business lines that report directly to the CEO and to the board of directors.    But at Equifax, you were using an outdated corporate governance model and had your chief information security officer reporting to the general counsel, not directly to the CEO, and board.    So my question is, why was your chief information security officer not reporting directly to you and the board? And why were you using an old model? Was it because you don't think that information security was important enough to be reported directly to you?","Congresswoman, I don't believe it matters where the chief information security officer reports. It was a priority for me. It was a priority for the board. It is a priority for the company. Having--",1100,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11530956105,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Zuckerberg, you have roots in my district, the 16th Congressional District of New York. I know that you attended Ardsley High School and grew up in Westchester County. As you know, Westchester has a lot to offer, and I hope that you might commit to returning to Westchester County perhaps to do a forum on this and some other things. I hope you would consider that. We will be in touch with you. But I know that Ardsley High School is very proud of you.    You mentioned yesterday that Facebook was deceived by Aleksandr Kogan when he sold the user information to Cambridge Analytica. Does Facebook therefore plan to sue Aleksandr Kogan, Cambridge University, or Cambridge Analytica perhaps for unauthorized access to computer networks, exceeding access to computer networks, or breach of contract, and why or why not?","Congressman, it is something that we are looking into. We already took action by banning him from the platform, and we are going to be doing a full audit to make sure that he gets rid of all the data that he has as well.    To your point about Cambridge University, what we found now is that there was a whole program associated with Cambridge University where a number of researchers, not just Aleksandr Kogan--although to our current knowledge, he is the only one who sold the data to Cambridge Analytica.    There were a number of other researchers who were building similar apps. So we do need to understand whether there is something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger action from us.",101100,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no
11393834022,"OK. And there were--the reason for that, cited, was substantial confidentiality interests. And I just wanted to clarify. Is not producing the documents--is the reason for that is the President actually asserting executive privilege in this matter?","I don't believe there was an assertion of executive privilege. There are law enforcement-sensitive documents and documents involving ongoing investigations that traditionally, over decades, the accommodation with the department and the Congress is that those are not produced because they are law enforcement-sensitive items.",101000,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11531504102,"This is to get a little bit to the budget we are actually here to discuss, there is a program in your Agency called Leaking Underground Storage Tanks, short in acronym is LUST. The money that goes into that fund is supposed to be used to clean up or prevent leaks from underground storage tanks. To your knowledge, is there anything under current law that prevents a State from using it for other purposes? In other words, the money is supposed to be used to clean up these underground storage tanks, but my understanding is very few States use it for that purpose.","You know, Congressman, I am not aware of that happening but it is something that we would investigate and look into if you have some information about that happening in your State and elsewhere.",100101,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes

Our staffing levels were actually in pretty good shape. The overall size of the work force, the Foreign Service Officer work force, by the end of this year, will have at or near more Foreign Service Officers than ever in the history of the United States of America.

So is that decision scheme, is the decision process made public, and can we know who? Can we get that information?","Congressman, let me clarify now, if I may.

As you likely know, I served as the chair of the Democratic National Committee at the time of the Russian hacks and when Russia weaponized the messages that it had stolen.    But I want to be clear my questions are not about the harm done to any individual by WikiLeaks and the Russians, it is about the possible and likely harm to the United States of America and our democracy. I have a series of questions that I hope will connect more of these dots.    Mr. Cohen, is it your testimony that Mr. Trump had advance knowledge of the Russia-WikiLeaks release of the DNC's emails?","I can't -- I cannot answer that in a yes or no. He had advance notice that there was going to be a dump of emails, but at no time did I hear the specificity of what those emails were going to be.",100001,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no
11531349132,"Along those lines, I want to pick up where Mr. Meeks and Mr. Capuano questioned you. I have shared with your staff a recent article from my hometown newspaper about black home buyers continuing to be denied conventional mortgage loans at a much higher rate than whites, even when controlling for income, loan amount, and neighborhood.    In the St. Louis metropolitan area, African Americans who applied for conventional mortgages are two and a half times more likely to be denied than non-Hispanic whites. That is according to 2 years of recent HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act) data.    Where there is loan activity houses have a chance to sell. Where houses sell, people move in. Where people move in, restaurants, community centers, and grocery stores are built. None or very little of that is happening in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods in St. Louis or elsewhere in this country.    My question is, what can the Federal Reserve do to ensure that applicants for home mortgages are treated equally and the bad actors who steer and redline communities of color are eliminated from this process or change their policies? Can you give me any direction in that area?","I would be glad to, sir. First of all, racial discrimination in mortgage lending, in any kind of lending, is completely unacceptable. Wherever we have authority we will use it to stop that from happening and punish it when it does happen.    We have some authority here. The CFPB has quite a lot of authority in this area as well, but where we have it for the banks that we supervise, we supervise carefully and aggressively to try to find these problems and address them.",101000,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no

Mr. Sensenbrenner referred and you referred to the statute that says that you can't bring Guantanamo detainees to the United States. I think the Chairman in his opening remarks commented obliquely that this might be dangerous to do so, et cetera.    My question is the following: Forgetting the legalities for the moment, if Guantanamo were closed, if detainees were brought to super-max security facilities, prisons in the United States, in what conceivable way could this threaten anyone's safety? In what conceivable way could housing someone in a super-max Federal prison affect the local community, especially when you're talking about 60 or 70 people, not 7,000 people, throughout the country?

I am very concerned by this troubling pattern of retaliation which is not only potentially illegal but is also creating a hostile environment that is expediting the exodus of valuable expertise from the EPA. In place of those dedicated public servants you are installing industry lobbyists.    Let's look at the case of Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, an expert who fought to finalize a ban on methylene chloride, a deadly chemical used in paint strippers. The New York Times and other media have reported that her efforts were opposed by Nancy Beck, the chemical industry lobbyist you put in charge of regulating chemicals. Just last year, Nancy Beck was being paid by the chemical industry to lobby against chemical regulations. Now that she is retired, Nancy Beck is running the chemical program and the proposal to ban methylene chloride has been abandoned.

Before I ask a general question and a broader question, I do note that I think you are my fourth Chairman to be able to visit within this environment since I have been a member of this committee.    I would like to discuss an issue with you today that you and I have already discussed. My good colleague, Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Luetkemeyer has a bill regarding, and that is the supplemental leverage ratio clearing margin.    I know that Blaine's bill has strong bipartisan support from members of this committee and the Ag Committee. In essence, it would offset those margin amounts for purposes of SLR because margin is inherently a risk management tool and legally must be kept separate from a bank's own funds.    The Fed can effect this change without legislation, however, and your predecessor showed a willingness to look at the issue. I was hoping you might be willing to consider that situation, that sort of a fix yourself?","Thank you, Mr. Lucas. What we are doing right now is we are taking a careful look at the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. I think our view is that the leverage ratio is a very important requirement for banks, but it should be a backstop. It should be a high and hard backstop to risk-based capital.    I think that the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio that we put into place in, I guess 2013 in that range, went a little too far. It unfortunately seems to be deterring some low-risk wholesale-type activities that we really want financial institutions to engage in. One of those is client clearing, and particularly not counting margin.    But I think our way of addressing that is going to be, I think, to lower the calibration of the enhancement to the supplemental leverage ratio. That does seem to get done what needs doing there.",100000,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

However, according to an article in Fortune Magazine published on September 26, you are retiring with a payday worth as much as $90 million.    So my question to you, sir, do you believe it is right for you to walk away with a payday worth $90 million when the lives of more than 145 million hardworking Americans had been potentially compromised?","Congresswoman, one, again, I do deeply apologize for the breach to those American consumers.

The EPA Inspector General is looking into those raises and last week the IG released preliminary information showing that the forms to grant the raises were signed by your chief of staff, Mr. Ryan Jackson, who wrote that he was signing on your behalf.

In the 1960s, our Government, acting through the FBI and local police, maliciously tricked individuals and organizations into participating in something called COINTELPRO, which was a counterintelligence program where they tracked and shared information about civil rights activists, their political, social, civic, even religious affiliations, and I personally was a victim of COINTELPRO.    Your organization, your methodology, in my opinion, is similar. You are truncating the basic rights of the American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness by the wholesale invasion and manipulation of their right to privacy.    Mr. Zuckerberg, what is the difference between Facebook's methodology and the methodology of the American political pariah J. Edgar Hoover?","Congressman, this is an important question because I think people often ask what the difference is between surveillance and what we do. And I think that the difference is extremely clear, which is that, on Facebook, you have control over your information. The content that you share, you put there. You can take it down at any time.    The information that we collect you can choose to have us not collect. You can delete any of it. And, of course, you can leave Facebook if you want.

Is our expectation--that is roughly back of the envelope, one-third, two-thirds ratio. Is it your intention to keep that same ratio of mortgage-backed securities?    Again, many of us are concerned about the possibility of the Fed involved in credit allocation decisions. Because right now, I don't really see a glide path to a treasuries-only balance sheet.","No, sir. Our intention over the long term is that the balance sheet would be no larger than it needs to be to implement monetary policy, and that it would consist primarily of treasury securities.    We purchased the mortgage-backed securities in the aftermath of the crisis. That was an unusual practice, and it was something that we did in unusual circumstances.

11636001109,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Acting Attorney General, as you mentioned earlier, there are other important matters within the purview of the Justice Department and within the oversight responsibilities of this committee besides fishing expeditions, trying to get the goods on this President in an apparent effort to impeach him. For example, 70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017. I am old enough to remember back in the mid '80s when President Ronald Reagan and his wife felt so compelled to do something about the scourge of drugs in this country that the effort to just say no began and other efforts following that, and that was because back at that time, we had 10,000 deaths a year due to drug overdoses, and we now have over 70,000 deaths. So it is gotten, unfortunately, over time worse, not better. And most of the increase in deaths in 2017 were due to synthetic drugs, synthetic opioids specifically, like fentanyl, which accounted for a significant number of those deaths. This is clearly an epidemic which has been declared a state of emergency nationwide by the President and has deeply affected families in my home State of Ohio as well as families all across this Nation.    What efforts and resources has or does the Justice Department intend to use to combat this growing epidemic, and what help can Congress provide to assist you in your efforts?","Congressman, I appreciate that question, and I know how Ohio has been dramatically affected by the opioid crisis. We have done a lot at the Department of Justice, and I would like to partner with this committee and I am sure General Barr would as well to combat and have additional tools to combat this opioid crisis. But some of the things that we have done is we set up in 2017 the Opioid Fraud and Detection Unit, which was a way that the Justice Department could utilize data to help combat the devastating opioid crisis. We did the largest healthcare fraud takedown in June of 2018. We set up the PIL Task Force, otherwise known as the Prescription Interdiction and Litigation Task Force, in February of 2018. We set up a really innovative way called Operation SOS, which was Synthetic Opioid Surge. General Sessions and I went down to Tampa, Florida, where we saw Manatee County had taken an AUSA and embedded them once a week into the sheriff's office in order to take every fentanyl overdose case, and they dramatically reduced the number of overdose deaths in Manatee County.

11497630018,"I want to cover one more topic that concerns me greatly.    During the FBI's investigation of the IRS matter, the President stated on Super Bowl Sunday that there was not ``even a smidgeon of corruption at the IRS.'' At the end of that investigation, no charges were filed.    Two weeks ago, the President stated with respect to Secretary Clinton's e-mails, ``This is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered.''    Should we expect that when the FBI finishes its investigation of this matter that no charges will be filed? Does the Department allow statements by the President to dictate its investigative practices?","Mr. Chairman, the Department reviews facts and evidence submitted before it. We apply the law to those facts and evidence. We take all the appropriate steps in every matter that we review. And that is how we will essentially manage every matter under our purview, whether it relates to the IRS, to an e-mail matter, or every matter that comes before us.

They have got millions of people crossing their border every day. They are not saying they are being invaded. There is no talk about building a wall.

They say 2-3 million people may be coming across. But they were going to try to make sure they take care of them, not prevent them from coming across.

Does Facebook have the ability to detect when a foreign entity is attempting to buy a political ad, and is that process automated? Do you have procedures in place to inform key Government players when a foreign entity is attempting to buy a political ad or when it might be taking other steps to interfere in an election?","Congressman, yes. This is an extremely important area. After we were slow to identify the Russian information operations in 2016, this has become a top priority for our company to prevent that from ever happening again, especially this year in 2018, which is such an important election year with the U.S. midterms, but also major elections in India, Brazil, Mexico, Hungary, Pakistan, a number of other places.    So we are doing a number of things that I am happy to talk about or follow up with afterwards around deploying new AI tools that can proactively catch fake accounts that Russia or others might create to spread misinformation.    And one thing that I will end on here, just because I know we are running low on time, is, since the 2016 election, there have been a number of significant elections, including the French Presidential election, the German election, and last year the U.S. Senate Alabama special election.    And the AI tools that we deployed in those elections were able to proactively take down tens of thousands of fake accounts that may have been trying to do the activity that you are talking about. So our tools are getting better.    For as long as Russia has people who are employed who are trying to perpetrate this kind of interference, it will be hard for us to guarantee that we are going to fully stop everything.

It seems to me that a Presidential campaign using a law firm as a conduit to pay for activities with which the campaign itself doesn't want to be directly associated is more than just dirty politics; it's also, quite possibly, illegal. To me, it seems that this is at least a violation of campaign finance laws for failure to accurately disclose the actual recipients of campaign disbursements.    However, this type of arrangement is not illegal--if it's not illegal under current law, I fear that we're risking opening Pandora's box with all sorts of underhanded activities by campaigns being laundered through law firms and shielded under attorney-client privilege.

I think we need stability throughout the globe, and we look forward to working with you on that issue.    Tomorrow, the chairman and I will be traveling to the Venezuelan border in Colombia. And I have kind of a two-part question. First is I do not think failure is an option here, but what would be the consequences for the United States and the region if Maduro succeeds in Venezuela? And the second part is, if Maduro does not succeed, what would a post-Maduro reconstruction strategy look like?","So, I am of the nature that I try not to contemplate failure too often, but we have certainly considered what the risks are associated with the efforts that we have provided to date and the efforts. Frankly, you mentioned the Lima Group, all the countries in the region now, some 50-some that have recognized the proper leader, as designated by the Venezuelan people through their constitution.    Look, we have seen Russia continue trying to exert influence. We know that the Cubans are providing substantial support to the Maduro regime. Allowing Maduro to continue will have as its primary negative outcome continued destruction of the Venezuelan economy and real hardship for the Venezuelan people. It will certainly have an importance in terms of the risk of terror, the risk of chaos, the economic, and refugees flowing from those regions, from Venezuela to the region as well. So, there is lots of downside if the Venezuelan people's objective is not achieved.    Second, the day and week after is going to be a long process. The Maduro regime's destruction of the economy in Venezuela is not as a result of the sanctions that the United States has put in place over the last months. This is years of socialist leadership that has completely put their primary revenue source, their fossil fuel resources, in a place that is going to cost, I have seen estimates between $6 and $12 billion, and years to repair. So, the day after means making sure the Cuban and Russian influence are out; Maduro and his cronies are all gone, and we begin to rebuild the democracy. And the world will have to provide the economic assistance to get them through this transition period.    The United States will certainly be part of it, but I am confident we will find the coalition that we have built, some 50 countries strong, that our State Department has built, will be part of that as well.",100000,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

I have had a lot of constituents over the years who have been very concerned about decisions in various agencies that get made by Administrators or the bureaucracy, and in some cases they can't get access to the underlying data that underpins the decisions. The proposal that you put forward this last week or so, how does that address that issue? Are we going to get science that everybody gets a chance to see that can be replicated that maybe is peer-reviewed so we are all working off facts?","And actually this has been an interest of Congress.

In 2016, prior to the election, I was contacted by Keith Davidson, who is the attorney--or was the attorney for Ms. Clifford, or Stormy Daniels.    And after several rounds of conversations with him about purchasing her life rights for $130,000, what I did, each and every time, is go straight into Mr. Trump's office and discuss the issue with him, when it was ultimately determined, and this was days before the election, that Mr. Trump was going to pay the $130,000, in the office with me was Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. He acknowledged to Allen that he was going to pay the 130,000, and that Allen and I should go back to his office and figure out how to do it.

11420722000,"Thank you, General Lynch.    We'll now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions for the witnesses, and I'll begin by recognizing myself.    Before being confirmed as Attorney General in May of last year, you were first nominated by President Obama to serve as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and you were originally appointed to the U.S. Attorney post in 1999 by former President Bill Clinton.    The existence of Secretary Clinton's private email server was first brought to light in March of last year, 1 month before your confirmation as Attorney General. A few months after your confirmation, the inspectors general of State and National Intelligence requested the Department of Justice investigate whether classified information was stored on her private email servers. The FBI then opened an investigation into the matter.    Given that she was a political appointee of your current boss and, more importantly, the wife of your previous boss, why did you not see fit to recuse yourself from the investigation? Wouldn't recusal or appointment of a special prosecutor have removed any appearance of impropriety given your service during Bill Clinton's Presidency?","Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman.    As I've said on several occasions before, when the referral came into the Department of Justice, it was received and referred to experienced, dedicated career agents and prosecutors who handle matters of this type every day with independence, with efficiency, with thoroughness, and the matter was handled like any other matter.    It was reviewed through the chain by those independent career agents and prosecutors.

And we were asked to pick which one the FBI would prefer.",100100,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11531349033,"I don't either. But it is a risk that normalization after this unprecedented, unconventional policy is created. To dovetail off of what the Chairman's point was in terms of the roll off strategy, it would be important if there are not enough maturing mortgage-backed securities, that mature in order for the Fed to actually hit its monetary roll off targets. To that end, to avoid an inverted yield curve, do you anticipate perhaps selling assets?","No, I certainly feel that our balance sheet normalization plan was carefully crafted and carefully rolled out, and the markets took it without much of a reaction. I think I would have little inclination to change the general parameters of it.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

How does the Department of Justice investigate such unauthorized disclosures?","Mr. Chairman, that could implicate a number of legal prohibitions.

Did somebody at the Department of Justice seemingly share a draft indictment with CNN prior to Stone's arrest or prior to a grand jury's finding of a true bill?","Ranking Member Collins, the court had a sealed indictment that after Mr. Stone's arrest was unsealed. Consistent with all of its prior indictments, the DOJ's basic policy for transparency in criminal cases is that the indictment is posted on the DOJ web page promptly after it is unsealed, and then media outlets were notified.    We do not know of any, and I do not know of any, other Special Counsel's Office notice or DOJ notice to media outlets regarding Mr. Stone's indictment or his arrest and otherwise--you know, I really, as I sit here today, don't have any other information that I can talk about regarding Mr. Stone.",110000,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11635589139,"Thank you.    And would you trust Iran with a bone saw? In other words, earlier the question was, would you trust Saudi Arabia with a bone saw; therefore, we cannot give them nuclear weapons or engage with them at all. I think an important point to note is I would not trust Iran with a bone saw. They have quite a few bodies, frankly, on their conscience from Syria, from a lot of places.    And so, I just want to commend you and the Administration for your decision to get out of the Iran nuclear deal. I think that was a smart move. I think it sent a very strong message that it is not just about the development of nuclear weapons over a period of 10 years; it is also about behavior in the region and development of ballistic missiles. So, I just want to commend you on that.    Closer to home--actually, I want to hit Yemen real quick. The very first thing this committee did--and I hate to obsess about it and channelize on it, but it has really stuck with me--the very first thing this committee did, Mr. Secretary, in the new Congress was, basically, to take away the authority of the Administration to be involved in any way with Yemen. And I think most of the members of this committee have never had a classified briefing on what is occurring in Yemen. They have never had a briefing on the SCIF. And I think there is a perception out there that it is the United States and Saudi Arabia that are creating a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.    Mr. Secretary, can you briefly talk about maybe the Houthis' role in a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, many actions of Iran, and maybe some of the role that we do not hear about in terms of who is really driving that crisis?","I am not sure I can do it briefly, but let me try.

Now, 20 years later, it is in utter chaos. And I think it would also impact Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia. It could really transform the Western Hemisphere and be a major foreign policy victory.    On China, as I get my threat briefings, Islamist terror has always been the focus, but it seems to me that China now is becoming more the No. 1 threat in nation States. Can you tell me about the threat from China? In particular, what I am concerned about is the One Belt One Road Initiative. You know, their theft of intellectual property--they are in our medical institutions, our universities. But the One Belt One Road, they are literally overleveraging countries, and particularly in Africa, too, where they can take over these countries without a shot fired. And they are in Sri Lanka now--they have that port--and in Djibouti.    What is the Administration doing to counter the Chinese threat?","So, the first thing we did is we identified it, something previous Administrations were loath to do. I get it. We have important economic interests with China. Many American jobs depend on that. President Trump is doing his level best to set the trade relationship so that it is fair and reciprocal. So, I would describe that as the first thing the Administration did.    The second thing is we recognize this is a great power battle and we are engaged in it across the world. It is our support of ASEAN. It is identifying the threat from Chinese State-owned enterprise technology companies, sharing that with countries in the Middle East and in Europe, identifying these risks, so that Western democracies around the world will wake up to the risks and will push back.    And you mentioned One Belt One Road, in particular. We are doing our best to make sure that there are Western competitors every place there is a project that China is putting forth. We are happy to compete. If it is fair, transparent, open transaction, you know, the Chinese may win a few, but I am very confident that American businesses will do incredibly well there.    What we have seen is just the opposite. We have seen transactions that were not straight-up, that were not fair, that were designed with a national security interest, and not an economic interest for the people of their country. The State Department has shared with these countries and their people and their leadership the risks from entering into these. And frankly, I think countries throughout Asia/Southeast Asia are waking up to this concern as well.",100000,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Now you look at the massive number of things we publish, we are much more transparent. I think we can continue on that path. We are never done with that.    In regulation, I think it is very important that we be transparent. In fact, we are working across a broad range of issues there, including, I would point out, stress testing.

11530956047,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And welcome to the committee.    A number of times in the last day or two you have indicated that, in fact, you are now open to some type of regulation. And we know, of course, that you are the dominant social media platform without any true competitor, in all frankness, and you have hundreds, if not thousands, of folks that are--would be required to help navigate any type of regulatory environment.    Some would argue that a more regulatory environment might ultimately stifle new platforms and innovators some might describe as desperately needed competition, i.e., regulatory complexity helps protect those folks like you. It could create a harmful barrier to entry for some startups, particularly ones that might want to compete with you.    So should we policymakers up here be more focused on the needs of startups over large incumbents, and what kind of policy regulation--regulatory environment would you want instead of managing maybe a Fortune 500 company if you were launching a startup to take on the big guy?","Congressman, thank you. And let me say a couple of things on this. First, to your point about competition, the average American uses about eight different apps to communicate and stay connected to people. So there is a lot of competition that we feel every day, and that is an important force that we definitely feel in running the company.    Second, on your point about regulation, the internet is growing in importance around the world in peoples' lives, and I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation. So my position is not that there should be no regulation, but I also think that you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place for a lot of the reasons that you are saying.    I think a lot of times regulation, by definition, puts in place rules that a company that is larger, that has resources like ours, can easily comply with but that might be more difficult for a smaller startup to comply with.

Yesterday, there were press reports--and I don't know if they are accurate, and I am interested if you are able to tell us--that the Russians have also hacked the telephones of Democratic staffers and that there was a request for Democratic staffers to bring their cell phones into the FBI to have them mirrored.    Can you tell us anything about that?","I can't at this point. What I can say in response to the first part of your question, any hacking is something we take very seriously. Any hacking in connection with this Nation's election system is something we take extraordinarily seriously, the whole of government. So it is something the FBI is spending a lot of time on right now to try and understand. So what are they up to and what does it involve and what is the scope of it to equip the President to decide upon the appropriate response. And so that is one of reasons I have to be very careful about what I say about it. That work is ongoing. I should make clear to folks when we talk about our election system, there has been a lot of press reporting about attempts to intrude into voter registration databases. Those are connected to the Internet. That is very different than the electoral mechanism in this country, which is not.",100,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

The first, from July 24, 2017: ``So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered [Attorney General], looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?''    The second, from November the 3rd: ``Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and the FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.''    The third, also from November 3rd: ``Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI and Justice Dept.''    I believe he is referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren in that last one. When Richard Nixon spoke about us that way, at least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors.    Mr. Attorney General, a few questions for you. ``Yes'' or ``no,'' please.    In a functioning democracy, is it common for the leader of the country to order the criminal justice system to retaliate against his political opponents?",Is that a question?,11,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

11530242044,"Mr. Smith, thank you.    You know, we have--I had a long meeting this past week with some experts in data security and how they can be protected. And one of the comments that was made was that when it comes to information technology budgets, the average company only spends 6 percent on security. Do you know off the top of your head roughly what your company spent for security out of their information technology budget?","Congressman, I do.

Let me move on to another topic. The latest available data from the Justice Department shows that, during fiscal year 2015, the government reported 6,002 new weapons convictions. This number is down 5.8 percent from the previous fiscal year, when the number of convictions totaled 6,373. Compared to 5 years ago, when there were 7,101 weapons convictions, the number for fiscal year 2015 is down 15.5 percent. Convictions over the past year are lower than they were 10 years ago. Overall, the data show that convictions of this type, weapons violations, are down 34.8 percent from the level of 9,206 reported in 2005.    The President has repeatedly called for new gun control laws, yet your department has seen weapons prosecutions and convictions fall to levels not seen in over a decade.    How do you explain such a precipitous drop in weapon prosecutions and convictions under this Administration? And why is such little emphasis placed on these types of prosecutions, when the President has called for yet more laws when the current laws are not being enforced?","Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.    With regard to the Department of Justice enforcement of the gun laws, we take those gun laws very seriously and are committed to using the full panoply of laws and regulations on the books.    We typically use those laws at the Federal level in conjunction with our many and numerous violent crime initiatives. For example, in my former position as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, many of our gang cases also carried with them firearms charges. They would not necessarily be the lead charge, they may not be reflected in the data that you have, but they certainly are an important tool in every prosecutor's arsenal in combating violent crime.

At that time, you stated that you didn't know.    Now that a week has passed and you have had a chance to consult your records and speak to your staff, are you prepared to tell us how many employees were fired for failing to meet their sales goals?","Thank you, Congresswoman.    Of the 5,300, which is about 1,000 people per year out of our team--and I don't want to minimize it; it was 1 percent, because we have about 100,000 people in our bank branches at any one time--all of those people, through our investigation, were terminated because of their unethical behaviors.

Some people, you may just want to make sure they are protected because there are allegations about them that turn out not to be true. And it is not fair for those to be published.

What are you doing to help clean up these brownfields sites that litter our neighborhoods and our country?","You know, we just issued a series of grants across the country this week with respect to the Brownfields Program, and you are right. It has been a tremendous success reclaiming polluted areas across this country to allow communities to once again enjoy those areas. And so with the partnership of Congress, the increased omnibus, you know, provided additional monies there for us to enhance that program, we are administering those grants and seeking to partner with communities all over the country to ensure that these areas are cleaned up and re-purposed and able to be enjoyed again by those communities.",100000,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11531504117,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Administrator, for coming before us. I think that was the first policy question you got from the other side of the aisle. Observation.    And to the public, I think this has been a lot of a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that we are seeing too often here in Washington that, unfortunately, I think works against civility and respect for people in public office. I am hoping we would be able to stay on policy today as much as we could, but I can see some just can't resist the limelight, the opportunity to grandstand.    So, having said all that, I thank you for what you have done. You have been able to stay disciplined on these policies. I know in West Virginia the impact that it has had on Brownfields Legislation of what you are doing on that I see the rollback of some of the regulatory reform that there is hope now. A lot of the people in the fossil fuel industry that they could see that deterioration in the past 8 years prior to that. There is some hope. We are seeing the economy start to rebound thanks to you and the administration of taking this fight on.    So I know that if I could, I know just as an example, here was an example that despite what has been said to the achievements that you have made that the EPA just awarded $1.9 million to research in drinking water having to do with Flint, that research in Flint. People are ignoring the progress that we are making and they are trying to make this another attack on President Trump, and unfortunately there are a lot of people that are going to go along with that.    So if we could, if I could get back to one of the things that has disturbed me some with some of the events over the last numbers of years was we had a good friend in Leslie Lampton who passed away last week. Lampton has Ergon Refinery located in Mississippi but they have the only refinery in West Virginia. It is a small, kind of a boutique operation at 23,000 barrels. I know the definition of a small refinery is 75,000 barrels, so they are a third of the size. But yet, so they are struggling meeting all of the qualifications, all the requirements of a major refinery.    Is there something that we could work together or something to help out these small refineries so that they can compete? Because they can't handle the RINs, they don't have a market for that with them. So is there something that we could be doing to help out these boutique refineries?","Congress has been very helpful in providing a small refinery exemption under the statute. It is objectively determined. It is 75,000 barrels, as you indicated, production and we have received I think 24 applications in 2017, a little bit over 30 in 2018. And I would say to you that the volatility of the RIN trading platform is creating instability across the entire RFS discussion.    So it is really in everyone's best interest to get more clarity and confidence in how this RIN trading platform and relief needs to occur. It is going to benefit the ethanol industry, benefit the ag sector, and I think benefit those that are suffering with the RIN obligations. And so it is our hope that we can chart a path forward with Congress to achieve those kinds of outcomes.",101000,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes

But let me go to the second one. Again, this is my concern that users currently may not know or take affirmative action to protect their own privacy. Yes or no, is Facebook changing any user default settings to be more privacy protective?","Congressman, yes.

We have established that you knew about at least some of these efforts. They caused you such concern that you, quote, ``shut George down.''

I understand that Facebook does not sell user data, per se, in the traditional sense. But it is also just as true that Facebook's user data is probably the most valuable thing about Facebook. In fact, it may be the only truly valuable thing about Facebook.    Why wasn't explaining what Facebook does with users' data higher priority for you as a cofounder and now as CEO?","Mr. Chairman, you are right that we don't sell any data, and I would say that we do try to explain what we do as time goes on.

You know, every day, about 100 billion times a day, people come to one of our products, whether it is Facebook or Messenger or Instagram or WhatsApp, to put in a piece of content, whether it is a photo that they want to share or a message they want to send someone, and every time there is a control right there about who you want to share it with.    Do you want to share it publicly to broadcast it out to everyone? Do you want to share it with your friends, a specific group of people? Do you want to message it to just one person or a couple of people? That is the most important thing that we do, and I think that in the product that is quite clear.    I do think that we can do a better job of explaining how advertising works. There is a common misperception, as you say, that is just reported--often keeps on being reported--that for some reason we sell data.    I can't be clearer on this topic: We don't sell data.

This idea that somehow they are having this dialogue now, they keep walking away from this dialogue with the opposition.

And I'm concerned that you keep on saying that you have deferred the authority that by law is yours to Director Comey.    Let me give an example. Mr. Comey has said that Secretary Clinton was extremely careless in her handling of highly classified, very sensitive information. Now, the criminal statute uses the word ``gross negligence.'' And I can't for the life of me figure out what the difference between ``gross negligence'' and ``extremely careless'' is unless one really wants to parse some words.    Now, secondly, the misdemeanor statute does not require intent. It's a strict liability statute, and it relates to the removal and retention of classified information. So it doesn't matter whether Secretary Clinton had the intent to do that or not; the fact is that the FBI said that she did it.    Now, I think that what Director Comey has said is that Secretary Clinton's actions essentially meet the definition for prosecution under the statute. Why did you defer to Director Comey when the responsibility is yours?","Thank you, Congressman, for the question.    Let me be clear that my decision was to accept the recommendation of the team of agents and investigators who worked on this. And these are the career attorneys as well as the dedicated investigators, including the FBI Director, who worked on this matter for over a year.    They've reviewed the facts.

When internal emails came out about this new policy last week, they revealed that it had been developed entirely by political staff, seemingly without a robust outside stakeholder process, and once the press started covering those emails they were removed from the Agency's public FOIA portal.

Mr. Administrator, you like to claim that you support the rule of law and acknowledge the limits of EPA's authority. Many of our environmental statutes are clear.

Certainly we have statutes and laws to that effect with regard to adults, criminal matters, and the like.

11531349059,"Chairman Powell, welcome. As the Chair of our committee points out, you are required to be independent and accountable. You are also required to be tall and short.    Your opening statement mentions great exports. But you don't mention that our trade deficit has gone up by $60 billion in the last year. I would point out that the entire economic establishment in this country has made it almost prohibited to discuss the trade deficit. That is why the country elected Donald Trump President.    Now, the Chair of the subcommittee boasts that we had a good economy in 2017. He is right. We had Obama's fiscal policies, Obama's tax policies, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, Janet Yellen's monetary policies and her big balance sheet, and we had a great year.    As a matter of fact, we have been on a roll since 2011. We were closing in on having a high enough employment rate so that we would have a labor shortage and higher wages. We were going well, and so instead of continuing to be on a roll, we have abandoned those policies and adopted a profligate tax and spending policy, throwing away the budget caps, $1.5 trillion plus interest of the debt from the tax bill.    But I think that we will still do well because our scientists, our entrepreneurs, and our workers are the best in the world, and they will make up for all the mistakes we are making here in Washington.    I see behind you, sir, the green shirts that call for full employment. It is not enough to go with the economists' definition of full employment, say 4 percent. We need real full employment that causes a labor shortage and desperate employers bidding up the price of labor.    That is also consistent with the fact that many economists are saying that you should be aiming not for 2 percent, but 2-1/2 percent inflation. That is the kind of expansionary economy that will allow these folks to come back in fancy polo shirts with the same slogan on it in a couple years from now.    Now, when we talk about some workers getting a $1,000 bonus, yes, a few have, but a family of five's share of the increase in the national debt from the tax bill is $26,000. What greater proof do we need of the need for financial literacy in this country than that some charlatan can say, ``Here is the deal. I will give you $1,000. It is money in your pocket, and we will just slap a $26,000 mortgage on your future.''    Now, Chairman Powell, in your confirmation hearings, you said that, I believe, that no bank is any longer too big to fail. I would point out that the biggest banks are bigger now than in 2008 when they came to us and said they were too big to fail; they would pull the entire economy down. We had to bail them out with $700 billion.    I would point out that the Wall Street prices into the value of the banks' stock, but more importantly, to the value of their unsecured debt, an implicit Federal guarantee, an assumption that they will be bailed out.    I have a number of questions for the record, but I will actually ask one for you to respond to. We have adopted these profligate fiscal policies. Huge tax cuts leading to a massive increase in the deficit number that is right behind you, then we busted the budget caps.    Is our monetary policy going to need to be more restrictive this year than it would have been had we not adopted these profligate fiscal and tax policies?","Thank you. Of course when we are setting monetary policy we are focused on achieving stable prices and maximum employment. In doing that, we consider many, many factors all around, the global economy, et cetera.    Fiscal policy changes can have an effect, and changes of this size can have an effect. That can be seen, of course, in the path to policy. It is very hard to say in advance what that would be, but the answer to your question is generally we take all those things into account.",1100,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11635589016,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Secretary of State, thank you and welcome.    I want to talk a little bit about the Western Hemisphere and what is going on. I see a bigger plan in what is going on in Venezuela I think than most people. I see a lot of similarities of what happened with Cuba and what is happening in Venezuela. In Cuba, they allowed the people to leave that were disenchanted with the government. In Venezuela, there are 5,000 people leaving every day. They expect, by the end of this year, to be about 5 million people that have left Venezuela, those who are disenchanted with this government.    I really believe that there is a bigger plan here to destabilize the Western Hemisphere with what is going on in Venezuela. You have a million people putting a great deal of pressure on Colombia, and they have opened their doors and they have done a great job in helping these people. You have 700,000 people going into Peru. You have people all the way down to Argentina. Some of these countries cannot absorb the quantity of people that are leaving Venezuela daily. So, to me, I think this is part of a bigger plan to destabilize this whole region.    It continues to keep us busy. It continues to make America the bad apple in all this. And I would hope that we will continue to put pressure on Maduro. I do not believe in military action, but I do believe that sanctions will be effective and working with the Lima Group will be very effective.    This afternoon, I am meeting with Fabiana Rosales, the wife of Guaido. She is very concerned about her husband. She feels that any day now they are going to pick him up, and God knows where they are going to put him.    Are we prepared to increase our sanctions and make it even harder for Maduro to continue being in power if anything like this happens?",Yes.,100000,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

When our construction, our building over there, needs assistance and needs attention, that we should be able to do that, and certainly under the exact same provisions that they are. And the fact that they would not allow that, while we allow them to build on Connecticut Avenue, on the high ground, mind you, as a military officer, that concerns not only me, but many Americans greatly.    Moving on, with the advent of the Mueller report, I am wondering if your Department is starting to investigate people at the State Department that used their official position to distribute elements or discuss elements of the Steele dossier, with the intent of sparking an investigation into the President of the United States, that work in the State Department, those folks. Are there ongoing investigations or are you considering investigations at this time?","I am going to honor the commitment I made when I signed up for this gig. I am not going to talk about ongoing investigations that we have. But you can rest assured that, if we see malfeasance, misbehavior, those doing things that are inappropriate, the team understands their mission set, which is to hold every officer accountable against the mission set that the Constitution and President Trump have laid out for us.",1101,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11531349082,"Thank you, Chair Hensarling.    Thank you, Chair Powell, for being here. Good to see you again.    I want to go back to something that I think was touched on when you began your testimony this morning. During your confirmation hearing, you spoke about the importance of tailoring regulations to fit the specific scope and practices of a financial institution.    I think your quote was actually, ``Even as we have worked to implement improvements to the banking system, financial system, we have also sought to tailor regulation and supervision to the size and risk profile of banks, particularly community institutions.''    I just want to make sure that your view on continuing to tailor regulations to the specific institution has remained the same. You are still committed to doing that?","Very much so. It is at the heart of what we are doing at the moment, which is to focus on smaller institutions and, without losing any safety and soundness, try make sure that our regulation is no more burdensome than it needs to be and then work our way up the food chain.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11422125075,"Well, the target was not an ordinary target. I think we all know that. And since you announced that there would be no prosecution of Secretary Clinton in July, there have been several very material issues that are troubling, and would this not require a reopening of the investigation to solve those issues?",I haven't seen anything that would come near to that kind of situation.,100100,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11530956134,"Well, you have referenced there are audits that are ongoing. Are you making that information from those audits available to our friends at the agency, at the Federal Trade Commission?","Congressman, as you know, the FTC is investigating this, and we are certainly going to be complying with them and working with them on that investigation.",101000,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11530242059,"Thank you.    Mr. Smith, as you well know, Americans rely on the three credit bureaus, a select group of companies to safeguard some of our most sensitive information. And it is because these credit bureaus hold this key personal information that we subject your companies to very rigorous data security standards.    The credit bureaus are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) safeguards rule, which is intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of the information. So we have a law in place that protects--supposedly--against exactly what happened here.    And now we will see if the FTC is willing to enforce it. And if they are not, then we will know that Equifax is clearly above the law. The safeguards rule requires, among other things, that Equifax have an information security program in place that can identify reasonably foreseeable risk to the security of your data and can protect against these risks.    This risk was obviously reasonable, foreseeable, because the Department of Homeland Security literally sent you and the other credit bureaus notice warning you about the exact vulnerability that the hackers exploited. And yet, your security program did not protect against this obviously foreseeable announced risk.    So in my mind, this is the most open and shut violation of the safeguards rule that I have ever seen in the history of this country. So my question to you, Mr. Smith, is, do you believe that Equifax violated the FTC's safeguard rule?","Congresswoman, I understand your point, and it is my understanding we were in compliance with the safeguards rule and that the safeguards rule does not prevent 100 percent against data breaches.",110000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

The letter said this: ``On August 8, 2016, Roger Stone, a Donald Trump confidant, revealed that he has communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about the upcoming release of additional illegally hacked Democratic documents. Mr. Stone made these statements during a Republican campaign event while answering a question about a potential October surprise.''    Obviously, if someone is stating publicly that he is in direct communication with the organization that obtained these illegally hacked documents, I assume the FBI would want to talk to that person.    Has the FBI interviewed Roger Stone about his communications with Julian Assange or his knowledge of how WikiLeaks got these illegally obtained documents?",I can't comment on that.,11,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

But under what breach notification regime did you notify the public?","Well, Mr. Chairman, we were mindful of the State laws and trying to abide by all the State laws, while at the same time following the recommendation of Mandiant, making sure we had clear and accurate understanding of the breach. And as I mentioned earlier, that took weeks.    It was very difficult to retrace the footprints of these criminals, where they had been, what they had done.

11637282031,"Thank you.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to note at the outset that, while the Hatch Act does not apply to--it does not Members of Congress. And it is always interesting to hear from my friends on the other side about the blending of political and official when every day we see examples of elected officials using their current positions to propel their Presidential campaign messages.    Having looked through the materials in preparation for this hearing, I can't help but feel that the Office of Special Counsel's interpretation of the Hatch Act means that President Trump's top advisers must subscribe to the legal and political fiction that you can decouple an opponent's Presidential campaign from their current elected position.    And my concern with the OSC's interpretation of the Hatch Act at least appears to be bipartisan. Chairman Cummings even sent a letter to OSC on December 7 of last year, and here's a direct statement: OSC's guidance is wrong. There is no limit that criticizing a policy of a sitting President or any other politician is a violation of the Hatch Act.    Apparently that applies unless you're an adviser to this President.    But all that aside, President Trump's advisers are going to continue to act as his surrogates. So going forward, maybe we can help--maybe this hearing can help us understand what a senior counselor to the President is allowed to say on TV or social media without personally offending Mr. Kerner or anybody else in the OSC's office.    So if we're talking about a sitting Senator and we're talking about Medicare for All, I mean, is it okay to say I hope Bernie Sanders Medicare for All proposal is purely campaign rhetoric, because if he were to introduce a Senate bill which actually provided a $32 trillion pay-for, people would have to give up the coverage they trust, and taxpayers would be on hook for trillions of dollars? Is that an okay statement?","I'm not in a position to judge a statement like that. The way OSC works is we get complaints about statements.

We have got the managers here. And I was told that, because of that, we raised an additional $100,000 for DC literacy and feeding kids and stuff, so that is----    The other thing is, I usually put my stuff up on the TV. I don't want to do it very much because it is my dad, and he would be mad if he went international like you are. And he has been on Facebook for a long time. He is 88. It has been good for connecting with kids and grandkids.    I just got my mother involved on an iPad and--because she can't handle a keyboard. And so--and I did this last week. So, in the swirl of activity, I still think there is a positive benefit for my parents to be engaged on this platform. So--but there are issues that are being raised today, and so I am going to go into a couple of those.    Facebook made, developed access to user and friend data back--and your main update was in 2014. So the question is, what triggered that update?","Congressman, this is an important question to clarify. So, in 2007, we launched the platform in order to make it so that people could sign into other apps, bring some of their information and some of their friends' information to have social experiences.    This created a lot of innovative experiences, new games, companies like Zynga. There were companies that you are familiar with like Netflix and Spotify had integrations with this that allowed social experiences in their apps.

Now, you said yesterday that each of us owns the content that we put on Facebook and that Facebook gives some control to consumers over their content, but we know about the problems with Cambridge Analytica.    I know you changed your rules in 2014 and again this week, but you still allow third parties to have access to personal data. How can consumers have control over their data when Facebook doesn't have control over the data itself? That is my concern. Last question.","Congressman, what we allow with our developer platform is for people to choose to sign into other apps and bring their data with them. That is something that a lot of people want to be able to do.    The reason why we built the developer platform in the first place was because we thought it would be great if more experiences that people had could be more social. So, if you could have a calendar that showed your friends' birthdays, if you could have an address book that had pictures of your friends in it, if you could have a map that showed your friends' addresses on it.    In order to do that, you need to be able to sign into an app, bring some of your data and some of your friends' data, and that is what we built. Now, since then, we have recognized that that can be used for abuse too, so we have limited it so now people can only bring their data when they go to an app.    But that is something that a lot of people do on a day-to-day basis is sign into apps and websites with Facebook, and that is something that we are going----",1100,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11420722064,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, General Lynch, for taking the time to be here with us today.    You know, I get a sense that really we're in this political season, and there is so much disappointment on the Republican side in the country that they couldn't obviate the election through the legal process. You know, despite the fact that most of us--I mean, in the Congress--we use personal emails that are not official. I do, and I know many Members of this Committee on both sides of the aisle do that.    And Secretary Clinton, like her predecessor before her, General Colin Powell, used a private email system for convenience. She has expressed the view that that was a mistake. I don't know that Colin Powell has.    Certainly, we know from press reports that the official State Department email account was the subject of the worst-ever cyber intrusion of any Federal agency. What we don't know is whether her communications on a private email were actually more secure than had she used the State Department email system.    But after over a year and $30 million or more across various agencies and congressional Committees investigating this matter, your agency has finally made the determination to follow the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute. And I think, you know, to some extent, we're beating a dead horse here for political reasons.    And I think it's important because there are--to use your time here for other things. There are a lot of things that need attention that we're not giving attention to. And so I'd like to raise the issue--it may seem arcane, but it is really important--of the backlog in immigration courts.    You know, we have had a massive expansion of immigration enforcement from 2003 to 2016. We increased the U.S. Border Patrol and Protection and ICE from $9.1 billion to $20.1 billion. That's a massive expansion.    But, at the same time, we increased, in your department, the Office of Immigration Review and the immigration courts $199 million to $426 billion. We have a massive backlog right now. In Los Angeles, the backlog is 806 days to hear a matter in immigration court. In Chicago, it's 915 days; Denver, 983 days; Phoenix, 884 days. This is, I mean, really, years and years to hear your matter in court.    And I'm wondering if you have--obviously, we need additional resources, but what are your thoughts of managing this just unconscionable workload for the immigration courts?","Thank you, Congressman, for raising that important issue.    Certainly, with respect to the workload of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, their workload has increased significantly over the past several years due to the influx of those seeking to enter our country. We saw this problem begin several years ago, as you have noted. The backlog of more than 2 or 3 years is something that we had been noting and certainly back in 2014, EOIR decided to try and handle this matter by prioritizing certain types of cases and trying to work through that backlog.    Particularly, along our southwest border--you mentioned Los Angeles. You mentioned Phoenix. Although Chicago reflects an influx of individuals who have chosen to move further north. But particularly along our southwest border, we have been trying to work on those backlogs. The additional resources we have with the assistance of Congress--and I thank the Members of this Committee and other Members for their support--we have been able to add additional resources to the immigration courts.    We have, as far as 2016, hired 36 new immigration judges. We hired 20 new judges in 2015. And we have another approximately 100 judges going through the hiring process now.    It is our hope that this will assist us in not only handling the priority issues, but dealing with the backlog that often results from the other areas that we have to pull resources from. We are always looking for ways to make the system more efficient, to make the system deal with the important issues raised in immigration courts, to protect our borders as well as to provide due process to those who are in immigration court.",100000,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no

11637282106,So you would agree that the original intent of the Hatch Act was not to keep White House advisers from advocating for their boss' policies or in defense of the President's positions as compared to others criticizing them?,"I would not agree with that. I think the Hatch Act only exempts two people, the President and the Vice President, from its reach, and so Ms. Conway is bound by it.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11636001004,So the answer is yes. Thank you. Were you briefed on those matters at any point while you were serving as chief of staff to Attorney General Sessions?,"Chairman, I know you are very interested in the special counsel's investigation, and so I want to be very clear about this: Because General Sessions was recused from the special counsel's investigation, I had no involvement in the special counsel's investigation.",1100,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

Can you cite any other instance in which a witness to a criminal investigation, who has already been interviewed by the FBI, has been allowed to accompany and serve as legal counsel to the target of that investigation?","I can't from personal experience. It wouldn't surprise me if it happened.    The FBI has no ability to decide who comes to an interview in a voluntary interview context. If it was a judicial proceeding, a judge could police who could be there. And, obviously, lawyers are governed by canons of ethics to decide what matters they can be involved in.

11497630038,"Well, the question I had is, do you believe that the law is unconstitutional, as Mr. Craig has opined in last week's Washington Post? And would you ignore the law based upon that argument?","Well, Mr. Congressman, I'm actually not familiar enough with Mr. Craig's analysis to comment on that. So I'm not able to comment on his views about the statute.    Certainly, with respect to the existing state of the law, the Department of Justice is committed to fully following that. And the closure of Guantanamo Bay is being carried out in compliance with that law.    And so I believe that it is the view of the Department that we would certainly observe the laws as passed by Congress and signed by the President. Only very rarely would we take the step of finding that an unconstitutional provision was something that we could not manage. We would, of course, seek to work with Congress and the Administration to resolve that issue.",100100,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

And it is good to see Ms. Mary Elizabeth with you.    When you came into office, what were the biggest threats to the U.S. and the world that you guys saw or inherited from the previous Administration?","Goodness. You know, I get asked to rank all the time. It is always a challenge. There are some that are immediate, right? The threat from terrorism is on top of us. It is real. It is a threat every day. We have done our best to make progress. We have made progress in certain parts; in other places we still have a tremendous amount of work to do.    But the threats, our renewed efforts to build that coalition is to push back against what I will call the traditional power rivalries have been very real, the threat from China, the threat from Russia, the threat from Iran.

11386195068,"Okay.    And then you gave the--I cited it in my opening statement. You gave a presentation to the IRS Oversight Board where you highlighted this as you were talking about the Affordable Care Act.    If we can put that slide up.    This is from the presentation you gave according to the minutes of that meeting in front of the IRS Oversight Board. And I want to show, ``Federal tax law imposes privacy protections that bar IRS from disclosing Federal tax information.'' Down to the final sentence, ``This encompasses both the release of the data and the safeguarding of the data in the hand of the recipient.''    So if you are conveying--you can't pass this back and forth, you have to protect it. This was the presentation you gave in front of the IRS Oversight Board.    Now, let's go back to the email the chairman had in front of you, if we could. It is addressed to Ms. Jeanne Lambrew.

I mean, you know, we talk about fairness, I mean, if a person had one or two violations, here we have somebody who has 25 alleged violations, and basically nothing happens. What does that say to them? I mean, is that fair?","Well, Mr. Chairman, I think from OSC's perspective, we try to apply the law as fairly as we can. To emphasize what I said in my opener, we're going to treat the well-connected the same as the little guy we are going to have one standard. We're not going to have a two-tier Hatch Act enforcement system. Obviously, cases with ordinary Federal workers go to the board, the board sometimes also imposes punishment that may differ from what we recommend.    So sometimes that's simply--imposing discipline is not something OSC does, but we are going to bring cases fairly and equally, and that's what we've done here.",101100,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no
11530956107,"You mentioned before in your remarks hate speech. We have seen the scale and reach of extremism balloon in the last decade, partially because of the expansion of social platforms, whether it is a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that turned violent or to ethnic cleansing in Burma that resulted in the second largest refugee crisis in the world.    Are you aware of any foreign or domestic terrorist organizations, hate groups, criminal networks, or other extremist networks that have scraped Facebook user data? And if they have and if they do it in the future, how would you go about getting it back or deleting it?","Congressman, we are not aware of any specific groups like that that have engaged in this. We are, as I have said, conducting a full investigation of any apps that had access to a large amount of data, and if we find anything suspicious, we will tell everyone affected.    We do not allow hate groups on Facebook overall. So, if there is a group that their primary purpose or a large part of what they do is spreading hate, we will ban them from the platform overall.",101000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no

I believe that in his testimony he actually--the response to why there was a 2-month wait was that he was informed, and then for the next 2 months they were attempting to recover the lost emails from other host computers where those emails were located. So that just because you lose the emails from Ms. Lerner's hard drive, where she was the ``from'' sender, that they would exist in the ``to'' recipients. Computers never--I believe over 80 other host computers where they were looking. So that is part of the delay.    But I would like to know, also, the full extent of what was going on, as well.    Deputy General Cole, as I am sure you are aware the nature of the Justice Department's investigation into the IRS practices regarding the tax-exempt applications has been such a lengthy, lengthy discussion before various congressional committees. Despite unsubstantiated allegations that the Justice Department has prematurely closed its investigation for political reasons, Attorney General Holder has repeatedly confirmed before both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees that the Justice Department and FBI are still actively investigating this matter.    On January 29, 2014, the attorney general testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the matter, and I quote: ``is presently being investigated. Into the use of being done, an analysis is being conducted.''    Several months later, in April--on April 8 of 2014--the Attorney General further testified before the House Judiciary Committee and confirmed that the department's investigation was still an ongoing matter that the Justice Department is actively pursuing.    Deputy Attorney General Cole, can your please confirm that the department is still actively investigating IRS practices surrounding tax-exempt applications?","This is still an ongoing investigation, that is correct.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

Now, you are here because we have a constitutional duty to ask questions, and the Congress has the right to establish government rules. The rules are that you are here. So I need to ask the question, and I need to have my time restored so that you can behave appropriately. I will behave appropriately as a member of the Judiciary Committee. I have asked a question.    Did you have a confirmation hearing, and have you not yet appeared for an oversight hearing?","Congresswoman, I am an Acting Attorney General.

We have provided intelligence assistance. I saw that in my previous role and before I was the Secretary of State. You have seen our efforts all across the world, Ukraine and Georgia included, to push back against Russian efforts to interfere when elections are approaching, as we are in Ukraine today.    There are many elements. And I was speaking about things mostly that the State Department and the Department of Defense were involved in.

That report, pursuant to British law, shows that women at Barclays earn 26 percent less than men and receive bonuses that are 60 percent lower than men.    Now, I know that some of those reasons might be reasons as to who owns which position. But it certainly goes toward the idea of equitable distribution of the benefits of the economy.    Are you familiar with a rule that was proposed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2016 that was supposed to go into effect in March that would have required similar reporting by American companies over 100 employees, not just on the basis of gender but also on the basis of race and ethnicity?","No, sir.",100000,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

Why did you recommend that the President fire Ms. Conway, because that's a pretty stiff penalty. Would you agree?","Yes. Yes, sir. That is the harshest penalty, obviously, in a civil case like this. We did not take that lightly. It was based on the recommendation of the career folks who prepared the report. It's consistent with MSPB, Merit Systems Protection Board precedent, and it's based on the fact that we have never had a repeat offender. We've never had anyone that we had to write two reports to a President to. We've never had a situation where there were so many violations.

He was scheduled to appear before the committee in January, but he backed out at the last minute, citing travel obligations. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were disappointed in that, but Mr. Kelly sent a letter for the record that he would be willing to answer any and all of our questions regarding his lifetime ban from the banking industry and the illegal activities that led up to that.    It is now more than 3 months later, we have gotten no information from Mr. Kelly. We are told that political leadership has been preventing him from speaking with us, and if that is true, that is certainly disappointing. Two weeks ago, you were interviewed on Fox News by Ed Henry, and he asked you several questions about Mr. Kelly. In the interview, you said that the details of the settlement with the FDIC were private, and that none of us really know what happened.    So my question is, if Mr. Kelly is happy to share the details of his lifetime banking ban as a matter of transparency, is he not telling us the truth, or are you stopping him from doing that?","I think Mr. Kelly, if he is willing to share that with you, he should do that.",101000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

What do these increased prosecutions of firearms offenses indicate about the Department of Justice's commitment to fighting violent crime, particularly with the use of firearms, in this country?","Mr. Chairman, as a former Federal prosecutor who emphasized gun prosecutions, I've long believed that they have a significant impact in reducing violent crime. Professors, earlier this year, have explained that they share that view based on scientific analysis. It will be a high priority of ours. You are correct that prosecutions fell.    One instance that was raised during the Texas--terrific, horrible shooting at the church there in Sutherland, Texas, was the ability of an individual to get a firearm and whether or not they filed correctly their form before you get one that--it requires questions about criminal convictions and court marshals.    Those prosecutions, I've noticed, have dropped by over 50 percent in the last 3 or 4 years. I think those are worthy prosecutions.

But I am not the President so let me move on.    It has been reported that you have even gone so far as to retaliate against EPA's employees, punishing those who questioned your spending and management, and sidelining those who attempted to advance important public health protections. So I wanted to ask again, yes or no, because we don't have a lot of time, it has been reported that at least five EPA employees were recently reassigned, demoted, or otherwise retaliated against after they raised concerns about your spending.

Why shouldn't the American people have the same level of information about your investigation of those associated with Mr. Trump?","Well, I am not confirming that we are investigating people associated with Mr. Trump.

11531504000,"The gentleman yields back his time. The Chair thanks the Administrator. I will start the series of questioning, and I will recognize myself for 5 minutes for the first round.    We have obviously a lot of media presence here. I have been asked the last couple days what am I going to do, what am I going to say, and I said, ``Well, I am going to talk policy and stewardship.'' So half my 5 minutes is going to be on a policy issue, and hopefully that will save some time for us to talk about some stewardship issues.    Since you last testified before the subcommittee, the White House has hosted a number of meetings, some of which have included you and other Cabinet officials, senators, and various stakeholders, to discuss changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard. As I alluded to in my opening statement, those potential administrative actions hang like the sword of Damocles over efforts on Capitol Hill to reach an enduring, legislative solution to the problems of that program.    Are any of these administrative changes imminent, or will you commit to allowing Congress time to work on a legislative solution?","Well, Mr. Chairman, I think both are important, and I do think there are some regulatory options that we can pursue. Many have talked about transparency as an example with respect to the trading platform and the RFS trading platform, how long you can hold a RIN as an example, who can buy, who can sell RINs. There are those kinds of, I think, evaluations that we can engage from a regulatory perspective. And, as you know, there is also consideration about the RVP waiver and the E15 being allowed year-round.    I think that is something, it is a legal determination. It is not a policy determination. And we have been earnest the last several months evaluating that in hopes that we can get to a conclusion on our ability to take those kinds of actions. But I really believe that Congress' role in this is terribly important because as you look at the issues that we are facing with respect to the Renewable Fuel Standard and the viability of the RINs platform we need both Congress and our regulatory responses to be working together.",111000,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

11636001038,"I don't think you did, but let me just say this: Your iteration of the Department's longstanding policy appears designed to delay answering these questions as long as possible. I find that unacceptable. I understand the role of executive privilege and respect its value in our system of governance. However, Congress is a coequal branch of government. We have a responsibility to conduct oversight. This is a responsibility we take very seriously.    I have repeatedly tried to work with your office first in delaying the hearing until February and then in providing you our questions in advance. I did this because the executive branch's own rules governing assertion of privilege, which were issued by President Reagan and have been followed ever since, say that ultimately it is up to the President to decide whether or not he wants to assert executive privilege. You cannot repeat forever that the President might want to assert privilege.    I have given you a fair opportunity to prepare for the hearing and to speak with the White House in advance so that we could avoid this fight in the first place, but you don't appear to have done any of that. The Department's failure to do its due diligence here to me is deeply troubling. I do not believe that issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem, but I am going to give you the opportunity to rectify the situation.    After today's hearing, we will attempt to reach an accommodation with the Department to obtain answers to these questions. As part of that process, I ask for your commitment to return for a deposition before this committee in the coming weeks under oath with an understanding that the transcript will be released to the public as soon as practicable thereafter.    Any questions that are unanswered today or require consultation with the White House will be asked again at that proceeding, and I expect either a clean answer or a proper assertion of privilege claimed by the President. I would ask members on both sides of the aisle to make those questions clear for the record so we know what must be addressed at the future proceeding.    Now, in your capacity as Acting Attorney General, have you ever been asked to approve any requests or action to be taken by the special counsel?","Mr. Chairman, I see that your 5 minutes is up, and so--I am here voluntarily.

11531349031,"If I could point out a possible risk that is out there and have you react to it that was created by the unconventional monetary policy. Some have blamed the Fed for contributing to the 2008 financial crisis by producing an inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates exceeded long-term rates.    At the beginning of 2011, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes was almost 3 percent. But as of February of this year, that same spread has been whittled down to a mere 0.5 percent, and this is a 450 percent drop. Given a flattening yield curve, and economic conditions that you can see, call for raising the Fed funds rate, how will the Fed avoid another inverted yield curve?    Are there any plans within the balance sheet normalization strategy to roll off longer-term assets more quickly to counteract that flattening yield curve?","Flattening of yield curves in the past has been a precursor of recessions, but largely because in many prior recessions the Fed had to raise rates quickly to hold inflation down.    That is not the situation we have now. It is very typical for the yield curve to flatten as short-term rates come up, as the economy strengthens. I don't see a particularly large--there is always a risk of a recession at any given point in time. I don't see it as at all high at the moment.",100100,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

11532380042,"Thank you very much.    Welcome, Mr. Attorney General.    We're debating whether section 702 should be reauthorized, and I want to talk about that issue.    At the beginning, let me show you a poster that my campaign committee put up on the University of Whitewater campus in the 2014 election during a debate on the USA Liberty Act. And it says, ``The GOVERNMENT knows what you did LAST NIGHT! The NSA has grabbed your phone calls, texts, Facebook posts, and emails. Jim Sensenbrenner thinks that's an outrageous invasion of your privacy.'' And it shows that I passed the bill and asked the students to vote for me. It worked. My percentage on that campus went up 20 points from the previous election.    Now, we're talking about many of the same issues in terms of section 702. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was designed to collect foreign intelligence, not domestic intelligence, but, in reality, we know that a vast number of Americans' communications are also collected.    The committee took a great step in trying to balance security and privacy last week when we reported out the USA Liberty Act, which made significant changes to the program. Notably, this legislation specifies two ways the government can query the information under section 702: either foreign intelligence or evidence of a crime. USA Liberty Act ensures that the government does not abuse 702 by requiring that a warrant be issued to access content after querying information for evidence of a crime.    Now, Attorney General Sessions, you have stated on several occasions that you believe that a warrant requirement would hinder the government's ability to detect and stop terrorists. Yet this bill already provides the government to move forward without a warrant on foreign intelligence in emergency situations.    Why can't the USA Liberty Act be the compromise? Can't we allow the intelligence community to stop terrorists while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans?","Well, we can. And the constitutional rights of Americans should be protected. And I know you worked on the PATRIOT Act when it came up, with Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and others. And I know you're a champion of civil liberties.    So I would just say that we can do that. The act, as written, as in law today, has been approved by the courts and has not been found to be in violation of the law. And so that's first and foremost.    I know the committee has decided to put some additional restrictions on the way the act is conducted. We did not think that was lawfully required. Congress can make its own decisions, and we will continue to be able to share our thoughts about how the legislation should be crafted.",101000,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

11497630029,"Thank you.    The State of Alabama's plan to close 31 driver's license offices demonstrates how one policy decision can have wide-ranging discriminatory effects. The media's picked up on this. And this will make it harder for citizens of these rural counties to vote.    And I'm just as concerned about the discriminatory economic effects of this decision, which will fall hardest on rural, poor, and African-American communities. I imagine a Black farmer driving hundreds of miles across rural Alabama to renew an expired driver's license. And, on this Committee, we know what might happen to such a young man.    What tools does the Department have to combat discrimination in all of the ways it manifests itself? And how are you going to be using these tools in this case?","Thank you, Congressman.    With respect to the Department's enforcement of our various civil rights statutes, it is certainly robust and will continue to be so. While we no longer have the advantage of the preclearance provisions that were in the Voting Rights Act, we still have significant provisions of the Voting Rights Act that allow us to review actions and decisions taken, albeit after the fact, to determine whether there has been either a discriminatory intent or, as is very often the case, a discriminatory result.    We can engage in negotiation and conversations. Many times, we do that before we even move to litigation in an attempt to reason with or have a discussion with entities that are making significant changes. And often those discussions are very productive. I was pleased to see that, after discussions with Members of Congress, the State of Alabama may be making some modifications to those changes. And, certainly, those types of discussions are an efficient way to bring about change and raise these important issues.    But I will reiterate, Congressman, that the Department of Justice is committed to enforcing the civil rights laws that we do have on the books. And we are committed to a vigorous review of matters that are brought to our attention and will ensure full and fair and efficient review of those matters and take the action that is appropriate.",101000,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

So you are going to require that every one of these decisions or whatever they are based on, the data and the methodology as well as the conclusions are transparent and available to the public. Is that going to be on your website? How are we going to know this?","Well, it is actually a proposed rule, Congressman. It is actually something that we are taking comment on, and I am sure there will be a wide array of comment on that very proposal. But the objective, once again, is to ensure transparency, reproducibility, with respect to the science that we rely upon in making our decisions in rulemaking.",1100,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11531349113,"Yes, sir. Since repo rates go the opposite direction to LIBOR during market stress, do you anticipate any new systemic risks that arise in the banking sector from shifting to SOFR?","Yes, I do, I think systemic risk would be decreased by moving to SOFR. LIBOR spreads blew out during the crisis, and I think a risk-free rate, which is really used to price the vast derivative markets and not so much the bank lending markets. It is really much more in a derivatives based now, would be an improvement from a financial stability perspective to have SOFR over LIBOR.",100000,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

My question for you is, is intent to violate the law a requirement under 18 U.S.C. section 793(f)?","Well, Congressman, I think the statutes that were considered here speak for themselves. To answer further would require a discussion of the facts and the analysis of this matter, which, as I've indicated, I'm not in a position to provide at the time.

But as of last August, the Trump Administration said no, we don't want to know how you pay women, how you pay people of racial groups or ethnicity groups. We don't care about that.    Now, I personally think that is horrendous and I would actually say that, again, if you are interested in an economy that has some degree of equitability you need statistics. You need numbers. Anecdotal answers are very interesting and they make for good political commentary, but they don't help us address the problems.    I would ask therefore if something like that, that is new to Britain, doesn't seem to have impacted Barclays in any particularly bad way, but provides us the information we have to go forward to argue for pay equity across the board.    Now, I am a white male, but I am not interested in my success being at the expense of people who are not white men. I would ask, is the Fed interested in all, would you be interested in pursuing something--you oversee 7,000 entities, some of them large, some of them small, most of them pretty large.    Would you be interested in pursuing some degree of, not intrusive, but some degree of investigation as to how they pay their employees, if it is equitable or not?","First, again, I am not at all familiar with either the British bill or the EEOC proposed rule that was--I am not familiar with either of those.

I would suggest to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, he must not be saying when he's saying that he's seeking one honest that everyone on this side of the aisle is somehow dishonest. I know that can't be the case, particularly when some of us have broken ranks, for example, offering and asking for a subpoena with respect to child separation policies.    But to suggest that we're somehow dishonest by saying you're seeking to find one honest man because we believe that this is a charade and a waste of the time of the American people, I think that that is a questionable direction to go.    And with respect to the Obama years, I would just raise that it would be awfully nice if my colleagues on the other side would recognize the President sent up a request for $762.8 million for ICE when the problem that we had on our border was nothing like it is today.

March 9th marked the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of Bob Levinson from Iran's Kish Island. Bob is my constituent. He is part of our community back home in Coral Springs. He is a patriot, as you know, who devoted 30 years to serving his country, first, with the DEA, and then, a quarter century with the FBI. He is a husband of 40 years. He is a father of seven. He is a grandfather of six, five of whom he has never met.    Iran's despicable practice of holding Americans and other foreign nationals hostage should not be tolerated by any responsible nation. Mr. Secretary, I know you are well familiar with Bob's case and the Levinson family. Bob's son, Doug, is here today. I appreciate that you have always been willing to engage with the Levinsons and with me on this matter. And I would ask that you look for every opportunity to raise Bob's case; also, to make bringing Bob home a priority. I would ask that you implore the President himself to sit down with the Levinsons and the other families of others detained in Iran. And I am willing to work with you, Mr. Secretary, others in the Administration, anyone--anyone--who can help bring Bob home.    I would like to turn to Syria. Mr. Secretary, I am troubled by your Syria policy because I, frankly, do not understand it. I do not understand how freezing assistance, pulling back U.S. troops, and ceding American leadership to Russia and Iran will help protect our national security interests. I have a series of related questions.    The first has to do with the role of Russia in Syria. There have been now several requests for information, so that we can do the job that we are supposed to do in providing oversight, requesting information about the meetings that the President has had with Vladimir Putin, particularly the summit that took place in Helsinki, that took place without anyone there. We have an obligation on behalf of the American people to know what was said. And as the chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee, it is of great interest to me and our subcommittee to understand what may or may not have been said on the topic of Syria.    And my first question is, why has the Administration refrained from providing information of those Trump-Putin meetings to Congress?","Well, let me begin by saying, it is not remotely unusual for senior leaders to have private conversations with their counterparts around the world. So, to suggest otherwise I find surprising. I might use a different descriptor, but I will use ``surprising'' in a second.

In fact, as I had mentioned when you were here last time, I would absolutely advocate President Tsai addressing a Joint Session of Congress here in Washington, DC, sometime in the not-too-distant future.    As you know, you and I were elected together back in 2010, the historic 2010 class, majority-makers. And you have moved on. It was your first time, my second time, but you moved on to, I guess, to some would argue bigger and better things. But you are now Secretary of State. As you may know, I was first elected back in 1994, and a member of my class back then, Sam Brownback, was here for a while, and then, he moved up and on to the Senate, although we do not necessarily think that is ``up'' on this side of the building.    [Laughter.]    Of course, then he became Governor of Kansas. And the reason I bring Sam up is not only were we classmates, but he is no Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. And he did visit Taipei recently. And I would certainly encourage more visits like that.    So, I guess my question, Mr. Secretary, would be, do you think that the full implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act would improve U.S.-Taiwan relations? And can the people of Taiwan count on you to advocate for further implementation of that I think very important legislation, the Taiwan Travel Act?","So, I think it is important to consider all of these things in the context of the challenges from China. You have seen what we have done with respect to Taiwan. It was just in the past few days that we sailed through the Straits, that the United States Department of Defense----    [Interruption from audience.]",1100,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no
11420722045,"Well, what about that statement--never mind their position, but what do you think of the statement that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun? Is that true? Does it work?","Congressman, I think the issue, as is usual, doesn't really lend itself well to aphorisms and short statements. And it's my hope that the work of many on this Committee and, indeed, throughout Congress in having the discussion that has begun on this issue will continue so that we can, in fact, continue to work on the serious issues of access to firearms in our society.    Earlier this year, I did make several recommendations to the White House, which were accepted, for important ways for dealing with this issue, ranging from clarifying guidance on those who are engaged in the business and therefore must provide background checks for purchasers, ranging from clarifying rules on acquisitions of certain types of firearms and by those in certain business capacities, such as trusts.    But also, as part of that, a very important part of that was a request for additional funding for ATF for more resources to deal with the information and the issues arising out of gun violence, as well as funding for HHS to deal with the issues of mental health that place so many Americans in jeopardy.",101000,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

11530242050,"OK. As a result of this breach, the exposure is ginormous here, quite frankly. It could, I would imagine, bankrupt your company if something--if this was--for a number of reasons here.

It is cybersecurity, general liability insurance.",100000,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11420722043,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Thank you, Ms. Lynch, for appearing here today and for your service as Attorney General.    I am sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the over-hyped matter concerning Secretary Clinton's emails, but I am going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country.    We're all sickened by the killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile outside of St. Paul. According to the ACLU, Mr. Castile was the 123rd African-American to be killed by law enforcement this year. That is, of course, no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas. But the knowledge that Mr. Sterling's and Mr. Castile's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of Black men, women, and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been Black must spur us to take action.    ``Black Lives Matter'' is not a hashtag; it is an imperative. And I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard, and I hope you'll keep us informed on that.    But I want to go to a different matter, related, unfortunately. Exactly 1 month ago today, a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando.    Mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country. In 2016, there were 229 mass shootings, defined as shootings in which at least 4 people are shot. As you know, every day, on average, nearly 300 Americans are shot in murders, assaults, suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Forty-eight of them are children and teenagers.    This is a distinctly American problem. More than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year. In the United Kingdom, in 2011, 146 deaths to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; Japan, just 30; the United States, 33,000. You cannot tell me, no one can tell me, that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries.    A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher.    We have held exact--there is an epidemic of gun violence, and how has the majority in Congress responded? With emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails. We have held, of course, zero hearings on gun violence. We have passed no bills to address the issue. We have done nothing to require universal background checks. We continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets. We have not even prevented those on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.    That's why I was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic Caucus in protesting the Republican Congress' abdication on this issue.    Now, Ms. Lynch, what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA's favorite adage, ``The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun''? The police officers, after all, were armed. And what about, ``An armed society is a polite society''?","Well, Congressman, thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society.    I don't have a comment on the NRA's positions or statements.",1,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11420722029,"Thank you for your response.    I would like to ask you in a friendly way how we can--as a Committee, what is it that we can do to address the problem?    And we seek your friendly advice in that direction because we want to work together with all the branches of government, and the House Judiciary Committee is in a very unusually important position to play an important role in this.","Yes. Thank you, Congressman.    The Department of Justice is actively engaged in working with both communities and law enforcement to further these discussions, and, of course, efforts in our grant-making arena are important there. And we welcome and appreciate the support of this Committee and others in making sure the Department's grant-making operations are fully funded.    We also provide a great deal of support for law enforcement through training and technical assistance, for example, the bulletproof vest program, and our funding for body-worn cameras for so many police departments. Again, we thank this Committee and so many Members of Congress who have provided bipartisan support for those efforts, and we would hope that those efforts in funding, in particular, would continue.    Those are just a few of the examples of ways in which we hope to continue to receive support.    I would also note that the issue of criminal justice reform is a larger canvas upon which this conversation is being writ. And certainly we support the efforts by so many on this Committee and others throughout Congress to push that important legislation forward.    We have provided assistance in terms of many of the details that have been raised in the context of that legislation. I know this Committee, in particular, has spent so much time and effort on that, and we appreciate that and all of the issues that have been raised.    And that is an important way toward dealing with making our criminal justice more effective, more efficient, and more fair. That, in and of itself, will go a long way toward restoring faith and trust in the overall criminal justice system, which is also a problem often raised to my attention during my travels.    So the Department looks forward to continuing to support those important efforts.",100000,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

11635589098,"Thank you.    The chair now recognizes himself.    I have four questions for the record that I just want to have my colleagues be aware of.    The first of these is whether we can count on you to support continued assistance to Nagorno-Karabakh Artsakh, especially for demining efforts, and expanding support to health care and rehabilitation services, especially those injured in mines.    The second is whether we can count on you to support aid to Armenia for the 25,000 Syrian refugees that they have taken in.    The third is I am chair of the Sindh Caucus. Southern Pakistan's Sindh has faced extrajudicial killings, forced conversions of Hindu girls after they have been kidnapped, and then, forcibly marriages. And Dr. Anwar Leghari, the brother of a dear friend of mine, was subject to extrajudicial killing 4 years ago. So, I hope that you can pledge to raise a gross human rights in Sindh with the Pakistani diplomats that you interact with. And I hope that you will also be able to support more outreach in the Sindhi language from our Karachi consulate, and to support $1.5 million a year, so that the Voice of America can broadcast in the Sindhi language.    Now I want to pick up on Mr. Connolly's comments. Khashoggi was brutally murdered. So far, our sole response has been to tell 17 thugs that they cannot visit Disneyland, these 17 button men who will not get U.S. embassies. That is an inadequate response. I am going to suggest a better response.    There are a lot of things we could do to Saudi Arabia that may not be our traditional policy, may not be in our interest, but one thing that is in our interest is to prevent Saudi Arabia from getting a nuclear weapon for three reasons. If you cannot trust a regime with a bone saw, you should not trust them with nuclear weapons. Second, even if you think MBS is a tremendous leader for the future, he is a not a democratically elected leader. He could be overthrown by the Wahhabi clerics at anytime. And, of course, the Middle East does not need a new nuclear weapon.    What I have seen in this Administration recently--and it has just come out--is an effort to evade Congress, and to some extent evade your Department, and provide substantial nuclear technology and aid to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia refuses to abide by any of the controls we would like to see regarding reprocessing, enrichment, et cetera. And we see strong advocacy of this coming from a group called IP3 and others show seem very close to the Saudi regime.    In particular, we have seen your Assistant Secretary of State Chris Ford say the Department will conduct some nuclear cooperation through memorandums of understanding, which do not require congressional oversight or approval, rather than through a one-two-three agreement.    And we see that there were some six licenses granted by the Department of Energy which in normal course are made available to the public, but are, instead, being kept secret, all of which provide for the transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.    So, can I count on you and the Administration to release these six--they are called Part 810 authorizations--by the middle of this month?",I will have to look into it.,1001,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes

Last Friday, we read a new report suggesting that Mr. Trump's foreign policy adviser has been meeting with high-ranking, sanctioned officials in Moscow to discuss lifting economic sanctions if Mr. Donald Trump becomes President. The same report quotes, ``a senior United States law enforcement official,'' who says that this relationship is being, ``actively monitored and investigated.''

Madam Attorney General, I think the thing that I find so disheartening, so unfortunate, about FBI Director Comey's decision not to recommend criminal charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last week was that, for a lot of Americans, it looked like we're seeing a double standard, unequal treatment under the law.    Under the facts of the case as laid out by Director Comey, virtually anybody else, I think most Americans think, including myself, there would have been charges brought for a crime against virtually anybody else in this country. But the politically connected Hillary Clinton, well, we won't charge her.    I mean, look what Comey laid out. It's already been laid out to some degree, but I think it warrants doing it again. He found that, despite the fact that Hillary claimed that she'd never sent or received classified information over a private email, she'd actually sent 110 of them, over 100 of them, and 8 of those were determined to have been Top Secret at the time that they were sent.    Now, I assume that, based upon the way you've answered some of my colleague's questions prior to this, you're not going to acknowledge what I think virtually every other American believes, even her supporters, and that's to at least acknowledge, as Director Comey did, that she lied. Would you respond?","Congressman, with respect to the Director's statements, as I've indicated, he's provided really unprecedented access into his views of the matter, and I would refer you to them.    I understand the issue that you raise, obviously, is one involving perceptions as to whether or not charges would have been brought in some other situation. And, again, I can only refer you back to the Director's statements, where he chose to outline the fact that no other cases similar to this had, in fact, been brought.",1100,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

As you likely know, I am on the Immigration Subcommittee and I follow closely what your Department is doing in that arena. Your predecessor, Attorney General Holder, testified in 2013 before the Senate, and this is a direct quote: ``It is inexcusable that young kids, 6, 7 year olds, 14 year olds, have immigration decisions made on their behalf against them and they're not represented by counsel.''    Now, in July of this year, the American Immigration Council and several other organizations filed a class action lawsuit in District Court in the Western District of Washington challenging the validity of removal proceedings for children without appointed counsel. And their argument was that an 8-year-old couldn't receive a full and fair hearing in the immigration court without representation.    As you know, I'm sure, the Administration has made efforts to provide counsel to small children by funding nonprofit groups, but the Assistant Attorney General who argued, I think a Mr. Leon Fresco, actually argued contrary to that in the District Court. And I'm wondering if the Department's position has changed since Mr. Holder left the Department and whether you think it could meet due process to have an 8-year-old who speaks only Spanish appear in immigration court without a lawyer and be able to argue the nuances of immigration law and asylum law. Do you think that meets due process requirements?","Thank you, Congresswoman.

Now, there is little doubt that ISIS views the United States and the West as a strategic enemy, and there is little doubt that our immigration laws, our lawful immigration laws, have been abused on a number of occasions by people intending to perpetrate harm against the United States.    Do you agree with what your own FBI Director, James Comey, told this Committee regarding the inability to adequately vet and confirm the true identity because of the lack of information, databases, law enforcement resources, intelligence resources, and military resources available to us in Syria of Syrians who have applied for refugee resettlement in the United States?","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And, certainly, national security and terrorism are one of my own top priorities and certainly an area of concern for all of us. That is certainly our main concern.    At the same time, we do have a system for allowing not just immigration but refugee entrance into the country. As the FBI Director has noted, there is a process in place that allows for significant vetting of refugees from all countries.",101000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11426003139,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Today we are here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution with whom they entrusted their families' finances failed them. The Federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The Federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers, and the consumers lost. And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only 5 percent of that fine is going to go back to the consumers who were harmed.    Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away. More rules and regulations aren't going to make this go away. The fact is regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousands of employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues. The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward with a whatever-it-takes approach to meet sales targets, and regulators sat idly by, either oblivious or uncaring of these bad practices, even after reported in the news. And to top it off, regulators neglected to fulfill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be viewed as late to the game. Wall Street needs to be held accountable, but so does Washington. That's what we're here today for.    So my question to you, Mr. Stumpf, first is, how many regulators do you have in your bank on a daily basis?",I don't have a precise count of that.,1011,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

And, until then, I hope that you would join with me in a letter of inquiry to ask what new account-opening quotas they had for their bank tellers, how many people they fired for not meeting their quotas, or how many people they fired for opening phony accounts.    We have Wells Fargo before me, but I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience. Your colleagues should at least come forward with some assurance.

11420722157,"Thank you, Attorney General Lynch, for being here today.    And I think Americans see the duplicitousness of the arguments that have been made by Republicans here on this panel.    First, they question you about why you did not recuse yourself from the Hillary Clinton email investigation decision not to prosecute. And then, on the other hand, they criticize you for relying upon the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, of career professional investigators and prosecutors at both the FBI and the Department of Justice who made the decision and then recommended to you that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted.    And they take issue with these things, and then they bring back some 20-year-old salacious accusations against former President Bill Clinton. I think we've reached a low point on this Committee because we're talking about these things at the same moment that Americans are focused on the out-of-control gun violence in this country.    The chickens have indeed come back home to roost as a result of 20 years of NRA control of decisionmaking about firearms here in this Congress. Absolutely no action by Congress to restrain the flow of weapons of war onto the streets of America, weapons of war that are producing mass casualties, one incident after the other, with increasing regularity here in America.    Americans get it, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't. They're just tone deaf. And they insist on chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is over with, this controversy about emails from Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no evidence of any criminal activity.    But yet, as we approach the Republican convention to be held next week--where the candidate that they're going to nominate has been a tremendously divisive figure in polarizing this Nation, such that we can't do any work here in Congress.    And so I think the people looking at this hearing are just simply dejected. This is really a spectacle, as we get ready in Congress to leave for 7 weeks of vacation. The American people don't get 7 weeks of vacation, and I know you don't in your job. And we appreciate the job that you have done.    Can you tell me, General Lynch, whether or not, with respect to the Orlando mass murder, 49 people, innocent people, killed at the hand of a deranged gunman wielding an assault weapon, can you tell us whether or not you found any evidence that the gunman used any encrypted messaging to prepare for his attack? And have you faced any roadblocks related to accessing the gunman's social media outreach, be it encrypted or otherwise?","Well, Congressman, thank you for raising those important issues. And, of course, it was exactly 1 month ago today that those 49 innocent lives were taken from us so brutally. And I remember visiting Orlando and speaking with many of the victims' families, and their loss is still so incredibly close and fresh and painful.    With respect to the investigation, we are proceeding. We have gotten great cooperation from all of the law enforcement agencies in central Florida who have worked on this case, from first responders through the police department, still helping with the investigation. All the Federal agencies have come together.    We are still reviewing a vast amount of evidence, so I'm not able to provide insight into whether or not we have come across encryption at this time. I will say that we are moving forward with the investigation. We certainly are not encountering any difficulties with the teamwork on the ground.

The 3-day waiting period is part of congressional action that has already been voted on by Congress. And, certainly, it is a fact that, with the rise in purchases and the increased use on the NICS background system, there is ever more use of that system.    We are working to improve the NICS system to make it as efficient as possible. We've expanded the number of personnel working on those background checks. We are working also to improve the automated portion of the NICS system so that the dealers who go through the system will be able to get information more quickly and to be able to respond, either by proceeding or denying a sale or in other ways as appropriate.

11497630047,"I thank the Chairman.    And I thank the Attorney General.    Madam Attorney General, in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Department of Justice established and oversaw a victims' compensation fund that provided more than $7 billion to families who lost loved ones on that day.    In the years after the attacks, it became clear that thousands of first responders and survivors continued to suffer major health consequences from the attacks and their aftermath. Thousands of lawsuits were filed against contractors and others by these victims.    In 2010, Congress enacted the James Zadroga Act, which provided essential healthcare services to those in need and reopened the Victim Compensation Fund to those families whose losses became apparent after September 11, providing them an alternative to litigation. In the last 5 years, the Victim Compensation Fund has provided nearly 6,300 first responders and survivors with $1.4 billion in compensation determinations. Since we enacted the bill, I am aware of no further 9/11-related lawsuits.    Despite its current success, on September 30, 2015, Congress allowed the VCF and the World Trade Center Health Program to expire. Fortunately, there is legislation pending in the House to permanently reauthorize the Victim Compensation Fund and the World Trade Center Health Program. The bill now has the cosponsorship of 247 cosponsors, a majority of the House, including more than 50 Republicans, and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 65 cosponsors.    If Congress fails to act, thousands of first responders and survivors will lose access to compensation on which they depend to support their families when they are tragically gone. The VCF is preparing to shutter its operations once it has processed existing claims. If the VCF is not fully funded and reauthorized, the first responders and survivors who have already received the notice of their compensation could actually see that amount cut by up to 50 percent.    We are literally talking about taking money out of the hands of a sick police officer. I am deeply saddened to think that is how Congress plans to remember the heroes of 9/11.    Attorney General Lynch, do you agree that this is not the proper way to honor the heroes of 9/11? Don't you think that 9/11 survivors and the firefighters and police officers who risked their own lives to save them and have suffered health consequences because of it deserve the full support of the American people and a fully funded Victim Compensation Fund?","Thank you, Mr. Congressman.    This is, indeed, an important issue. Of course, we will always be deeply indebted to those first responders and brave men and women who risked their lives to search for and recover victims, to remove debris at the site, to carry out the recovery efforts at Ground Zero at 9/11.    It certainly is an important issue to me both as Attorney General and as someone who was in New York on 9/11 and who had friends and former colleagues who were in that group of those who were on the scene and who were involved in those activities. This is, in fact, a serious issue for those who were affected by it, and I greatly appreciate your expression of compassion for those who have fallen ill.    With respect to the bill that is currently pending, certainly, on behalf of the Department of Justice, we would do all that we could to work with you to make sure if there were any questions or issues they could be addressed. And we hope that there would be none.    This is, indeed, an important issue. And, again, I think it is something that deserves, certainly, strong review, serious consideration.

11635230026,One final question. The President claimed he knew nothing about these payments. His ethics filing said he owed nothing to you.

To any other White House official?,"Again, Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned in my opening statement, I do not intend today to talk about my private conversations with the President nor White House officials, but I will tell you, consistent with what I have already said, I have not talked about the special counsel's investigation with senior White House officials.",100000,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11497630132,"Mr. Conyers is still sitting here at the dais. Mr. Conyers very bravely took on the Bush administration. Where relevant U.S. attorneys and case law effectively now is that in fact if a Committee of Congress wants somebody, it is not a discretion to say no. In the case of Harriet Miers, that was pretty well adjudicated, and Mr. Conyers as Chair made it very clear that Congress has a right to have someone.    Again, I'll ask you finally. Previously the reason was not that you would not make a line attorney available, but Ms. Bosserman was part of an ongoing investigation. Since that investigation is done, are you saying today that you refuse to have her available under any conditions?",I'm saying that I am being consistent to the policy of the Department of Justice that we do not make line attorneys available.,101100,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes

11531504031,"Sir, I need to move on. I take that as a yes. To mitigate that concern it appears that the proposal has been crafted so that you, the Administrator, has the discretion to grant exemptions as you see fit without any transparency or accountability for your decisions. For example, if EPA was assessing the safety of a chemical, you alone would have the power to selectively block public health studies that do not support your political priorities and allow ones that favor your friends in industry. Not only does this open the door to special treatment for industry over the public health, but you could also pick winners and losers amongst the industry types.    Do you think it would be hypocritical to exempt industry data containing confidential business information from disclosure but not personal health information from public health researchers? Yes or no? Would it be hypocritical?","I think that is a misstatement.

A number of things I wanted to discuss. One of them is the DACA situation. And it seems, as I recall, that you had made a public statement some time back about the constitutionality of the policy that was implemented by President Obama. Would you care to reiterate that position today?","Well, the President--President Obama--indicated multiple times that he felt that DACA--he didn't have the power to do DACA in the way it was done. And eventually they must have changed their mind and executed this policy to take persons who were in the country unlawfully and to give them lawful status, work permits, and even participation in Social Security.    So I felt, for some time, that that was not proper. A Federal district court in Texas so held, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals also so held that it was unlawful. So what happened was, we helped work on the research, but the Department of Homeland Security withdrew the policy because it was not defensible, in my view.",100000,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11420722068,"Thank you.    General Lynch, you and I worked together on a myriad of issues, and I have great respect for many parts of the work you do and the way you do it. So I'm going to take a tack that maybe is more appropriate to my own district and to the men and women there who are asking certain questions. And I will run you through some quick questions, and it is really for them to understand. You are obviously a skilled attorney. You took an oath. You are under a penalty of perjury as you speak today. You prepared for today so that you would be able to answer some of the critical questions, including, obviously, the ones you have been asked so far. Is that correct?","I try and be responsive to the Committee's questions, and I appreciate the information that staffers provide about what's of interest to the Committee so that we can have the information for you.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11532380055,"Thank you.    Now, I want to show you an image from March 31, 2016, of a meeting of the Trump campaign national security advisory committee, which you chaired, with yourself in attendance, along with then-candidate Donald Trump and Mr. George Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos pled guilty on October 5 to making false statements to the FBI.    The charging papers filed by Special Counsel Mueller describe the March 31 meeting, where Mr. Papadopoulos told the group that he had connections and could help arrange a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. After the meeting, Mr. Papadopoulos continued to communicate with the Russian Government on behalf of the Trump campaign and appears to have told several senior campaign officials about it.    Now, here is the problem. On October 18 of this year, you said under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, quote, ``A continuing exchange of information between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian Government did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.''    Senator Franken asked, ``You don't believe that surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians?'', to which you responded, ``I did not, and I'm not aware of anyone else that did,'' unquote.    Now, we now know that, one, the campaign had communications with the Russians through Mr. Papadopoulos and others, and, two, you seem to have been aware of the fact at the time. So let's try and correct the earlier testimony now for the record.    ``Yes'' or ``no,'' did you chair the March 31, 2016, meeting of the national security advisory committee?",I did chair that meeting.,100000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11393834075,"So Mr. Cummings just made this big, big, big deal about this is no big deal. Well, in fact, it is. The Justice Department asked for information that you said is publicly available, but you go to Lois Lerner to get it. You get it in 2010 in the format you want it. It is 21 disks, 1.1 million pages. You say it is available publicly, but you don't get it publicly. You go get it from the IRS. And it contains confidential taxpayer donor information.

They are an easy target. We want to make sure that we work on that issue and work with you.    You sit in a position where you can harmonize those rules and regulations, I think, pretty easily with the different discussions and different groups of regulatory agencies that actually meet on a regular basis discussing things.    Is this ever discussed at all in your meetings with the Fed, the Treasury, FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), Comptroller, CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), any of those meetings? Is this ever discussed at length?","Yes, it is.

Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin? Yes. But I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion.    I was not part of the campaign. I don't know the other conversations that Mr. Trump had with other individuals.

11532380122,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    And thank you, Mr. Attorney General, for being here today.    Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is under investigation because of his work and ties to foreign governments. According to various reports, much of his work with these foreign governments went unreported when Mr. Flynn was required to make certain disclosures by law.    Now, as chairman of the Trump campaign national security advisory committee and lead adviser on the Trump transition team, I think you worked closely with Mr. Flynn, and I'd like you to answer a few yes-or-no questions about Mr. Flynn. And knowing that Mr. Flynn is under investigation, I'm going to stick to subject matter that predates both the special counsel's investigation and your appointment as attorney general.    Now, the foreign policy platform at the Republican National Convention undertook dramatic changes. Did you discuss changes to the Republican foreign policy platform with Mr. Flynn at any point during the campaign?",I don't recall it. I was not at the convention when the platform committee met.,100011,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

Why did the Bank approve a $75.8 million loan to a subsidiary of the state-owned Industrial Commercial Bank of China, when on April 23rd at your annual conference you said, ``It isn't easy going up against China, Russia, or anyone else to win export sales. The jobs come with them.'' You stated, ``More and more U.S. companies just aren't competing against their counterparts in China, Japan, and elsewhere. They are forced to compete against China, Inc.''    Why are we helping?","Sir, it is a complicated world out there. Some countries--",1100,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11386195047,"Thank you.    And I would like to thank Ms. Ingram for your public service and congratulate you on earning a reward, an award, for your work on combatting terrorism financing. As one who lost 500 constituents on 9/11, I know how important this work is. It is vital to our homeland security and vital to saving American lives. So I wanted to thank you for that.    I also think that it is important that we realize the impact the government shutdown is having on our economy. Because an important part of homeland security is economic security, and our economic security is falling. The stock market is closing at the lowest level in a month. The Dow Jones average fell 136 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 14 points. The NASDAQ fell 37 points. And consumer confidence is at an all-time low due to the threat of a default on our debt, on American debt.    I do want to make an important point, that 195 Democrats have signed a petition saying that they will vote today, they will vote in 10 minutes, to open up the government. And I feel if a vote was allowed on the floor, there would be enough like-minded Republicans that would vote, as we did on the Violence Against Women Act and other areas, jointly in a bipartisan way to open up our government.    And I would say that, instead of having a hearing on unfounded allegations, we should be looking at what the impact of this shutdown is on the IRS and other government agencies and their ability to provide services to the American people.    So I would like to ask you, Ms. Ingram, what is the percentage of people that have been furloughed in the IRS?",I have been informed that it is roughly 90 percent.,100000,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
11531504142,"And I guess, I think I would suggest it also creates at least the appearance of and independence.    And now it has come out that your head of security, who was promoted to that role after you fired his predecessor for questioning your security spending, did outside investigative work during the 2016 presidential election for America Media Incorporated, the publisher of National Enquirer. That includes the period when AMI purchased and killed a story about President Trump having an affair with a Playboy Playmate. Do you think that that outside work at least creates the appearance of a lack of bias?","It is my understanding that is being reviewed.

11422125099,"Okay.    My final question is the following. You investigated Secretary Clinton's emails and so forth, everything we have been talking about. You concluded, I believe quite properly, there was nothing to prosecute. And you have announced, in my opinion quite properly, that you had investigated it and there was nothing there--or there was nothing to prosecute. That was proper.    But having announced--when a prosecutorial agency announces that ``we have investigated so-and-so and we have decided to prosecute because'' or ``we have investigated so-and-so and we have decided not to prosecute because,'' why is it appropriate for that prosecutorial agency to go further and say, ``Even though we decided not to prosecute, we still think this person did this, that, or the other thing and it was proper or improper''? Why is it proper for a prosecutorial agency to characterize your opinion of the propriety of the actions of someone who you have announced that you have decided did nothing criminal and shouldn't be prosecuted?","That is a very hard decision. That is why it is the exception to the rule. You do risk damaging someone who isn't convicted.    The judgment I made in this case is, given the unusual--in fact, I hope unprecedented--nature of this investigation, that it was appropriate to offer that transparency. Not an easy call.

It has been widely reported that his family abuts a Superfund National Priorities List site. He is the head of the Superfund program, creating at least a perception of a conflict of interest in that he might be favoring the site that is next to his property. You have mentioned that one of your goals, one of your values, is that you are committed to good stewardship of taxpayer resources.    Has this financial conflict been reviewed by EPA ethics officials, and if so, were they provided with all the necessary information to conduct that review?","I don't have knowledge about that, Congressman, if that has happened or not.",1,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes
11636001121,"I thank the Chairman very much.    These are extraordinary times, Mr. Attorney General. We know that the former Director of the FBI testified to the House Intelligence Committee in open hearing that there was an active investigation into the associates of the Trump campaign, and he was fired subsequently. Mr. Mueller was then hired. Investigations have secured numerous indictments, convictions, or guilty pleas, and, of course, a deal with perjury charges like obstruction of justice, perjury, false statements. So, at the current rate, we are seeing so many of the Trump organizations being indicted, and with the short time that I have, I want to make sure that your questions are answered in a yes-or-no manner. This is the first oversight hearing we have had in the Justice Department in almost 15 months. You did not have a confirmation hearing, and you have not yet appeared for an oversight hearing.

This sounds eerily like the retail banking division.    Also, as I understand it, the Fed required Wells Fargo to submit a plan to investigate and to change policies and procedures.    I think you testified on the Senate side that you were not personally aware of the problems in the retail banking division until 2013. Surely you were aware of the problems in the mortgage lending division in 2011, correct?","That is correct. And Mr. Chairman, we shut that division down. That was even shut down--",110000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

11531349000,"Thank you, Chairman Powell.    The Chair now yields to himself for 5 minutes.    Chairman Powell, in your statement, you used the term ``normalization.'' I would like to explore that for a moment, and particularly with respect to interest on excess reserves. Is our expectation, should it be, that IOER is the new primary monetary policy tool, or will it instead be the fire extinguisher behind the glass that you break out in times of emergency? What should be our expectation?","Mr. Chairman, interest on excess reserves is currently the principal policy tool that we use to keep the Federal funds rate in the range that we designate. We have not made a decision in the longer run whether that will continue to be our framework or whether we will return to something more like what we did before the crisis.    I don't have a schedule for--I don't expect to be returning to that decision in the near term. I would just say that our current approach seems to be working very well.

I want to begin by applauding the President and your Department for taking steps to recognize the Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As you might recall, I wrote you a letter last year in that regard, encouraging that recognition. And I just think at this time, with Iran and their proxies, terrorist organizations, the IRGC, Hezbollah, all on the border, there is no more an important time than now to take this action. And I speak for all the people in the district that I am privileged to represent that are proud of this action, support it, and just say thank you very much. And we offer our support and assistance.    Moving on, regarding Tibet, I am just wondering, what is preventing the Administration from formally placing a diplomatic post in Lhasa?","It is something that previous Administrations and this Administration continue to review. We have to place it in the context of our larger policy, Indo-Pacific policy, even more broadly. We are trying to make sure that we get each of these steps right.    What President Trump has directed each of us to do is recognize facts on the ground, try to apply good common sense, and then, generate policies that actually get outcomes. I think for an awful long time, we have done things that made us feel good, but did not deliver. And so, with respect to this particular issue, and all the issues that surround it in Asia, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people. And so, as we consider the appropriateness of a lot of decisions on designations, on sanctions, on how the Department of Defense is going to posture, how we work with Southeastern countries, we want to make sure that we actually deliver for the American people.",101000,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no

Ms. Ingram, you have been attacked by several Members of Congress for personally directing the so-called targeting of Tea Party groups applying for tax-exempt status. For example, a Republican Congressman, Tim Griffin, accused you of being directly in charge of this targeting. Similarly, Republican Congressman Tom Price accused you of systemic harassment of conservative and religious organizations and argued that you should be suspended.

11497630098,"Let me ask you this. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General has done an analysis of--we have many people from Central America in particular who are seeking asylum. And what he reports, that there is a review called Operation Streamline that found that the Department of Justice has actually prosecuted asylum seekers for illegal entry before their asylum case is heard.    And it seems to me that while not only does that violate the requirements of international law, but it doesn't seem like an efficient use of resources. If someone gains asylum under the law, then their prosecution would not be very pertinent. And I'm wondering, have you reviewed that IG's report yet?","I have not reviewed that specific IG's report. What I can tell you is that the prosecution and apprehension of individuals at the border is one to which not just the Department, but the specific U.S. attorneys in those border States devote significant time and attention.

Can you explain what you believe is a public-private partnership with regards to this?","Yes, Congressman. There are two thoughts there: One, the rise and the intensity and severity of cybersecurity incidents around the country and the world is running at a pace that has never been seen before. And I am convinced there is more we can do in public-private partnership to get ahead of the curve on cybersecurity, not just reacting to it.    Number two is, the more I reflect, think, and talk to experts in the area of cybersecurity, I am convinced there is an opportunity for this partnership between public and private to rethink the concept of a Social Security number, name, date of birth as being the most secure way to identify consumers in the U.S.    It is an instrument that was introduced, as you well know far better than I, back in the 1930s.

And frankly, currently, the total amount of U.S. renewable exports last year was $1.4 billion. We would have had to finance essentially 150 percent of all U.S. exports in order to meet that target.

Bill Dudley will step down this year. The search for his replacement is under way. Historically, the New York Fed's close proximity to Wall Street has led to the selection of an individual with close ties to the financial sector.

If diverse candidates are not afforded due consideration, are you prepared to exercise your power as Chair to reject such candidates to serve as the next president of the New York Fed?    I know you have a lot on your plate, but I have to put this question to you because we have to do better about diversity, in particular at the highest levels. Not only am I looking at what is happening with the New York Fed and the possibility there, but we have to look at our own Fed, and think about how diverse is it at the top levels, management levels.

We always insist--and they don't need to be pushed into this, this is something they want to do--we always insist that there is a highly diverse candidate pool and that diverse candidates are given serious consideration and every chance to become the successful participant in that process.

That is a decision that most of the stakeholders at EPA violently oppose.    If you can't debate the policies in Washington, you attack the personality and that is what is happening to you. Republicans do it when it is a Democratic President. The Democrats do it when it is a Republican President. And in my opinion, and it is just my opinion, that is what is happening to you.

Chairman Issa and Chairman Jordan have accused the Department of Justice of conspiring with the IRS to create what they call in, ``illicit registry,'' of confidential taxpayer information to prosecute conserve organizations. Their claim is based on the fact that back in 2010 the IRS provided to the FBI 21 computer disks with annual tax returns, or form 990's, from organizations with tax-exempt status. According to your letter, these disks contain the forms of all groups that were filed between January 1, 2007 and October 1, 2010, ``regardless of political affiliation.''

New York Fed President Dudley and Boston Fed President Rosengren disagreed and said that they thought that quantitative easing had been effective.    My question to you is, do you think the Fed's quantitative easing program was effective, and do you believe the Fed should keep this tool in its toolbox for future challenges?","I do think our post-crisis policies were effective. I haven't carefully studied that report yet, but let me say that what these reports try to do is they try to identify the surprise element in a particular Fed announcement and isolate that from what was already priced into the market.    Most things that happen on announcement day are already priced in. It is very hard to isolate that surprise element. This paper takes a different way of doing that, and it comes up with the answer that comes in.    Overwhelmingly, studies of the effects of asset purchase programs suggest that asset purchase programs did their job, which was to create downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through the term premium.

11531504107,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Administrator Pruitt's ethical violations as the head of an Agency with a mission to protect the public's health demonstrate a concerning lack of integrity and a pattern of the rich and powerful putting their rich and powerful friends and their own self-interest above the interest of the public's health and at the expense of the common good. Clean air to breathe and safe water to drink is not a privilege only for the rich and powerful but a right for everyone, and the role of a public servant is to serve and protect the public, in particular the public's health.    However, the gross elimination of many public health protections are kickbacks to the rich lobbyists and corporation friends that have a real impact and I want to highlight one example. This week the EPA announced that it intends to limit the kind of scientific studies it will use in issuing new protections to only studies that make public the private, personal, confidential information of the people who participate in those studies.    Revealing that info is a clear ethical violation of any reputable research institutional review board in the United States. The type of studies you want to exclude are the same kind of scientific studies that were used to prove that lead in pipes and paints harm children and that secondhand smoke is a dangerous carcinogen. We are talking about landmark studies such as the Harvard School of Public Health's six-city study which proved a connection between air pollution and early death back in 1993. That just by living in a city with poor air quality your average life expectancy was lower than those who didn't. This study later became the basis of fine particulate matter regulations in the Clean Air Act.    When you were here in December, you and I spoke about fine particle matter which, thanks to studies based on confidential patient health information, we now know is associated with premature death, asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function, and respiratory diseases. You acknowledge these risks and agree that there is no safe level of fine particle pollution, but your new policy would block EPA from considering the studies that have shown these dangerous health implications.    So do you deny now that fine particle pollution has these health impacts, and will these new regulations cause your Agency to disregard these sentinel studies?","If they provide the data and methodology to the Agency and the findings, it will be used.",101000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

As you may know, the House, last month, passed a bill called the Judicial Redress Act, which, in my opinion, is essential to enforcing an umbrella agreement to transfer law enforcement information from certain European countries to the United States and vice versa.    If the Senate fails to pass this bill, in your opinion, what will be the effect on the sharing of law enforcement data with certain of our European allies?","Thank you, Congressman.    We fully support the Judicial Redress Act. And I actually would like to thank you and the other Members of this Committee for the important work that you've done on this issue.    As you have noted, this legislation is critical to continued law enforcement sharing of information from the U.S. and the European Union. In fact, I have been involved in discussions with ministers from the European Union on the Data Protection Act, often called the Umbrella Act, as well as the Judicial Redress Act.    It certainly is our view that this important legislation should be passed. It would provide, as you know, redress for European Union citizens should there be an unauthorized or misuse of their data here in the U.S., which is a privilege enjoyed by U.S. citizens within the European Union.    Without this, we do have a grave risk of not having the completion of the data protection or umbrella agreement.

11426003105,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    So, Mr. Stumpf, let me start by making a few observations, and then I'll end with a couple of questions.    First and foremost, I find it, as we all do, extraordinarily troubling that as I look through the history, the timeline of the scandal, a timeline that stretches over years, we see, as has already been testified to, 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were dismissed for their involvement in opening unauthorized accounts.    What's also interesting and troubling is the firings did not happen all at one time. My understanding, as we've heard already today, is that roughly 1,000 employees per year, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.    It's extraordinary. How Wells Fargo management did not actively and decisively move to stop those activities after the first 100 or 500, 750, or 1,000 employees were fired is beyond me. The fact that it was allowed to go on and on and on for years is apparently a failure of corporate governance, and a failure, quite candidly, of your management to do what is foremost, and that is to protect the customers who have trust in you.    What concerns me even more, however, is that it appears that most of the 5,000 employees who were fired were low-level or mid-level employees. I think the chairman just found out the highest level was a branch manager. And it doesn't even include those who resigned due to the culture at Wells Fargo. As I say, meanwhile, to the best of my knowledge, no senior executives have been held accountable in the same manner that the lower-level employees were. I would not be surprised if a number of those people ended up losing their homes or going into massive debt after they were dismissed.    No, I'm not defending their actions, just making a point that we have a problem in this country, where it would seem, as we've seen previously, that the well-connected here in Washington, the elite, if you will, and the well-connected on Wall Street, seem to play by one set of rules, while everyone else has to play by another.    Yes, I know you just lost, reportedly, I hear, $41 million of your salary, but if I understand that correctly, that's only a quarter of your pay over the last decade or so. And so you will forgive all of us if we don't really feel that sorry.    The second point I'd like to make is that, under Dodd-Frank, Wells Fargo remains fully eligible for taxpayer bailout going forward under Title II of the law should you run into trouble going forward. Taxpayers have already spent a lot of money bailing out poorly run Wall Street firms over the last decade. Mr. Stumpf, I hope you're aware that the anger now directed at you by my constituents and others around the country isn't just over the actions of the employees; it's the fact that they seem to be forever on the hook to underwrite whatever kind of risky or, in this case, fraudulent activity Wells or other large banks engage in.    Fortunately, earlier this month--I'll just make a sidenote--we passed out a bill out of this committee, the CHOICE Act, which will ensure that if Wells Fargo does run into trouble again, it's only its shareholders and its management that would pay the consequences and the taxpayers will no longer be on the hook.    The third and final point I'll make--and I know they're not here, but, once again, the financial regulators apparently were--more than ``apparently''--completely asleep at the wheel as this massive fraud was occurring.    If you look at one of those, the CFPB, the CFPB has only one job in a regulatory framework, and they completely blew it. It took a reporter from the L.A. Times to uncover what was going on at Wells Fargo. And so I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will keep that in mind as they may pat the CFPB on the back for a job well done.    In the time remaining, let's get to the securities questions. The Securities Exchange Act requires a public company to keep its disclosure in place--that's under SOX--requires the CEO and the CFO to attest to financial statements. You referred to some of that.    Are you saying that all of those quarterly reports you were filing, that the information you had in 2011 and 2012 and 2013 and 2014, none of that information was material?","At the time, given the facts and the circumstances, we filed accurate reports, and we did not believe it was material.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

11530956102,"Clarify and have more confidence.    The last question I have is, in yesterday's hearing, you talked a little about Facebook tracking and different scenarios, including logged-off users. Can you please clarify as to how that works and how does tracking work across different devices?","Yes, Congressman. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify that.    So one of the questions is, what information do we track and why about people who are not signed into Facebook? We track certain information for security reasons and for ads reasons. For security, it is to make sure that people who are not signed into Facebook can't scrape people's public information.    You can--even when you are not signed in, you can look up the information that people have chosen to make public on their page because they wanted to share it with everyone, so there is no reason why you should have to be logged in.    But, nonetheless, we don't want someone to be able to go through and download every single public piece of information. Even if someone chose to make it public, that doesn't mean that it is good to allow someone to aggregate it. So, even if someone isn't logged in, we track certain information, like how many pages they are accessing, as a security measure.    The second thing that we do is we provide an ad network that third-party websites and apps can run in order to help them make money. And those ads, similar to what Google does and what the rest of the industry does, it is not limited to people who are just on Facebook. So, for the purposes of that, we may also collect information to make it so that those ads are more relevant and work better on those websites.    There is a control that for that second class of information or an ad targeting anyone can turn off, has complete control over it. For obvious reasons, we do not allow people to turn off the measurement that we do around security.",100000,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no,yes/no

Are you recused from investigations that involve Secretary Clinton?","Mr. Chairman, it's--I cannot answer that ``yes'' or ``no,'' because, under the policies of the Department of Justice, to announce recusal in any investigation would reveal the existence of that investigation, and the top ethics officials have advised me I should not do so.",1,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no
11497630012,"Then why aren't they being prosecuted for those violations related to firearms?    And, by the way, this doesn't just mean using a firearm in the commission of crime. It also means illegal sales of firearms. It means lying on the Instant Check System of which, for the last year for which we have complete data, 76,000 people were found to have committed the felony of swearing to false information on that form. Five thousand were referred for prosecution, but the 94 U.S. attorneys' offices across the country could only find time to prosecute 62 out of 76,000.    So somebody going into a gun store to buy a weapon knows that, even if they're caught--and often they're not caught because the system doesn't have all the information it needs in it--but even if they're caught, they often find that the odds are one in a thousand that they'll be prosecuted even when they're caught.    What are you doing about that? What should be done about it?

11635230127,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Jordan.    The chairman and this committee have promised members of the American people a fair and open process, yet the Democrats have vastly limited the scope of this hearing. They issued a gag order to try to tell members of this committee what we can and cannot talk about.    My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that they want the truth, that they want transparency and fair oversight, yet the Democrats' witness to testify before Congress today is none other than a scorned man who is going to prison for lying to Congress.    Let that sink in. He is going to prison for lying to Congress, and he is the star witness to Congress.    If you read the sentencing report on Mr. Cohen words like ``deceptive'' and ``greedy'' are scattered throughout that report. It paints a picture of a narcissist, a bully who cannot tell the truth, whether it is about the President or about his own personal life. But today he is the majority party's star witness.    If the Democrats were after the truth, they'd have an honest person here testifying. And if they were really after the truth, they'd not restrict the questioning to just a few topics. But let's take a look at those restricted topics.    Mr. Chairman, the first topic in your limited scope that I can ask Mr. Cohen is about the President's debts. But, Mr. Chairman, didn't Mr. Cohen plead guilty to lying to banks about his personal finances? So we are asking a guy going to jail for lying about his debts to comment about the President's debts. He is the expert.    Mr. Chairman, your next couple of topics say that I can ask Mr. Cohen about the President's compliance with financial disclosures and campaign finance laws. But didn't Mr. Cohen on two occasions break campaign finance law with his own donations? So again, the majority party's star witness on the President's compliance is a guy who broke compliance laws himself.    Mr. Chairman, you graciously allow us to ask questions of Mr. Cohen on the President's dealings with the IRS and tax law. Your star witness here broke the law with regards to the IRS at least five times. He pled guilty on cheating on his taxes, lying to the IRS. He's the best witness you got?    Next up, with the permission of the chairman I get to ask Mr. Cohen about his perspective on the President's business dealings. Let me get this straight. The witness lied to multiple financial institutions to get loans to pay off other loans just to keep himself afloat, and he is going to be the expert on business practices.    Obviously, Mr. Chairman, the witness may produce documents that he suggests incriminates the President, yet he lies to banks. All of those lies were done on fraudulent documents, documents that he forged. Nothing he says or produces has any credibility. Apparently he even lied about delivering his own child, which his wife had to correct the record.    Ladies and gentlemen, how on earth is this witness credible? With all the lies and deception, the self-serving fraud, it begs the question, what is the majority party doing here? No one can see this guy as credible. He will say whatever he wants to accomplish his own personal goals. He is a fake witness, and his presence here is a travesty. I hope the American people see through this. I know the people back in Tennessee will.    And with that statement, sir, I have a few questions for the witness.    With your loss of your law license--I think you mentioned in your opening statement that you had been disbarred--what is your source of income in the future?",I don't expect I'm going to have a source of income when I'm in Federal penitentiary.,101000,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no

And in the case of one of the emails, you said, ``Hoping there is a quick answer while I prep for something else. Please copy me on the answer.''

11531349065,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, thank you very much for being with us here today. I also wanted to thank you for another effort you undertook, and that was in 2011. You spent a considerable amount of time with members of the House, trying to walk them through the debate that we had on raising the debt ceiling.    You were trying to get us focused on all the unintended consequences, which would occur if we did not raise that debt ceiling, and I very much appreciated the time, effort, and facts that you put forward.    You have a new voice now at the Fed. I assume your opinions on the severe consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling remain. I know that in August, it looks as though the Federal Government is going to have to borrow, or have to roll over, $500 billion of debt in August.    If we are in a quasi-default situation in August, then clearly it is a real question as who would want to purchase that debt and at what cost would they purchase that debt? Clearly a premium on that, a 10 percent premium, it would be a $50 billion hit right there to the interest expense, but there is much more than that that would befall the impact on our markets and, frankly, at corporate debt.    Maybe I could just give you this opportunity to explain some of the concerns about that issue?","Thank you, Mr. Royce. Of course we don't do fiscal policy at the Fed, but I will accept your invitation and just say that it is very important that the Federal Government and government generally be on a sustainable fiscal path, meaning as the baby boomer generation retires, we will need to address the significant fiscal issues that are coming to us over time. I think it is important that Congress do that.    At the same time, the debt ceiling should be something that we always raise in a timely fashion. There is no other country in the world that has a separate vote over whether to pay bills that we have already agreed to incur. I think the United States has never defaulted on a principal or interest payment and never should.    I think doing so would be something I would really hate to see and could bring very significant consequences.",100100,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

I have a question relative to the issue of the Guantanamo detainees. Congress recently passed and the President is expected to sign into law legislation that explicitly prohibits the use of Federal funds to move detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States.    Former White House Counsel Gregory Craig recently wrote an op-ed arguing that the law is unconstitutional and that President Obama can legally ignore it. Since you are America's top lawyer, do you believe that President Obama could legally ignore legislation prohibiting the transfer of detainees to American soil?","Thank you, Mr. Congressman.    What I would say on this issue certainly is, as the Administration has stated, the closure of Guantanamo Bay is something that is part of the Administration's policy, and the Department of Justice supports that, as well.    At this point in time, I believe the current state of the law is that individuals are not transferred from Guantanamo to U.S. shores. That position is reiterated by the legislation that you mention. And my understanding, as you indicated, is that I do believe the President has indicated that he would sign that.    And, certainly, it's the position of the Department of Justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard to that issue.",101000,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

Although it is not explicitly part of the Bank's charter, since 2008 appropriators have included language directing the Bank to make available not less than 10 percent of its aggregate authority to finance renewable energy exports.    Now, Chairman Hochberg, can you please describe how the the Bank finances renewable energy and environmentally-beneficial exports?","Thank you. For one, we apply the exact same exacting credit standards for large transactions and small, for renewable transactions or other transactions.    Renewable transactions--according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), globally the United States and other export credit agencies can extend loans as long as 18 years.    And in fact, Jim Rogers, former chairman of Duke Energy, said just recently that we need export credit agencies essentially to finance power projects, conventional and renewable, because banks will only lend for 5 to 7 years.

Having looked at that and the basis--that, essentially, your department launched everything you had against the Republican Governor, who everyone agreed had violated no State law. They took a Federal law--and you had cited looking at statute, relevant caselaw, and history. There was no relevant caselaw to suggest that setting up a meeting constituted a crime; no history, statutory history, that suggested it was a crime. And yet your department put everything it had in prosecuting that Governor.    Having looked at what the Supreme Court has now said, do you believe that prosecution was a mistake?","Certainly, I believe that the prosecutors who worked on that matter investigated it, presented it to a grand jury, and received an indictment.

You were talking to young students to get them involved in thinking about going into a career in the State Department. And I commend you and your team for doing that, because I look back when I grew up as a pretty sheltered life. I did not even think that was a realm of possibility. Again, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that.    I share the same beliefs as Mr. Sires, of my colleague, in regards to Russia, Cuba, China, and Iran, that there is maybe a destabilizing, coordinated effort underway to destabilize the Western Hemisphere. And I think you and I have talked about this, that Venezuela could be but the rubicon, because if Venezuela fails, it will show that Cuba, you know, they cannot survive because they are the ones that have been propping that up.    How do you assess that? And along with that, how should we respond to Russia's interference under the guise of support to the Maduro regime in Venezuela? And do we need to reemphasize the Monroe Doctrine?","So, I have spoken to my Russian counterpart no less than three times on the issue of Venezuela and their interference, the fact that they are undermining Venezuelan democracy. It was met with precisely what you would expect from them.    We are doing our level best to push back against the capacity of Cuba, who has had intelligence officers and security officers on the ground there today protecting Maduro. It shocks me that the Venezuelan military will tolerate these foreigners, right, coming to run their security service. As a former U.S. Army officer, it would have been embarrassing if a third country had to come in and provide security for the leadership of our country. But that is where we are today.    We are doing our level best to put sanctions in place, to put restrictions in place, and to, more importantly, build our coalition, not just in South America and Central America with the OAS and the Lima Group, but European countries from all the around the world who understand that democratic Venezuela is the only path forward and Maduro has to go before we can get there.",100000,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

It was marvelous.    At that event, you spoke about the breakdown in trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. You also spoke about getting to the root of the problem with a comprehensive approach to training, to policy, and to research.    Many of the law enforcement officers in attendance agreed with your comments. How are you planning on reaching out to the broader law enforcement community to promote these ideas?","Thank you, Congressman Conyers.    This is, in fact, one of my top priorities as Attorney General.

Through our COPS Office, in particular, the Community-Oriented Policing Service Office, we reach out directly to police departments across the country and offer technical assistance, we offer training, we offer peer-to-peer support.    We have found that an incredibly effective way to share information within the law enforcement community is peer-to-peer, police-officer-to-police-officer, chief-to-chief. And so we work with the departments that have, in fact, made great strides in the area of police-community relations and seek to match them up with other departments who are having challenges in this area and who would be receptive to their input.    I also, as I noted in my opening statement, have been on a six-city community policing tour. And as I talk with residents, with young people, elected leaders, I also talk with police officers. I do meet with chiefs and supervisors, but I also talk to the rank-and-file, the officers who are on the beats of our cities, to get their ideas as to what has worked in their city, as to why a positive relationship has developed in the cities where they have had challenges and where they have had struggles.
