I don't know. Some might speculate that.    But when Chairman Camp heard that Chairman Issa had subpoenaed you for tonight, you were all of a sudden notified that there was going to be a hearing in Chairman Camp's committee on Friday of last week.

2,11388494044,"Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    We have had an opportunity to interact in the past and always appreciate your candor. At the very heart of this matter is a basic fact that IRS appears to have been used prior to the election, the presidential election, in a concerted effort to close down or keep at bay conservative organizations by targeting them. You are aware of that, sir?","I am aware, as was noted earlier, that the inspector general found inappropriate criteria were used to select organizations for further review.

They want to pretend they don't exist, those stubborn facts. But they do exist. And they show this was not intentional, this was not nefarious, this was not a conspiracy.    Mr. Koskinen, are you aware of any evidence, documents, emails--and I remind you you are under oath; I also remind you you have been accused of false statements--are you aware of any evidence, documents, emails, or other information from IT professionals that calls into question the accuracy and the legitimacy of these emails?",No.,100000,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

Mr. Commissioner, even if you wanted to comply with this demand, how long would you estimate that it would take the IRS to complete this document production?","We have already spent 10 months, $15 million, and add 100,000 hours and 250 people working to produce the documents that we in fact agreed with the committee would be relevant. This is a much broader, more sweeping request to all of those documents, and I have continued to press our people, because I am anxious to get documents to the committees and investigators as fast as possible, how long it would take even to complete the redaction, and I cannot get a clear answer because it is a very complicated, difficult process.

Our subpoena says all of Lois Lerner's emails. Is it your position today that you intend to give us those responsive to some key search word or you intend to give us all of Lois Lerner's emails, all of Holly Paz's emails, all of William Wilkins's emails, all of Jonathan Davis's emails?",We are working through the process.

First I want to be clear that, just because I am engaging with you at this hearing, that it is not an acknowledgment that you are legally entitled to be the acting director of the Bureau. I believe Dodd-Frank was clear in this matter, and that Leandra English is the lawful acting director of the Bureau.    That being said, I have some questions.

9,11531417004,"I want to explore a little bit more--as you know, since we have worked together for many years, I have a number of concerns about CFPB. I am concerned about to what extent they do indeed protect consumers, because part of consumer protections is to protect their rights to a competitive, transparent market.    But I am also concerned about, have we simply eviscerated traditional foundational principles of checks and balances and due process.    So you just told us that, under the Dodd-Frank Act, if you so chose, you could sit here, put your feet up on the desk, and, I suppose, take out your iPhone and play Candy Crush for the next 4 hours, and there would be nothing we could do about it.    I also understand, I believe--and I mentioned it in my opening statement--that depending upon what side of the bed you wake up on, you could determine--you alone, in your solitary capacity, could declare any credit card in the Nation abusive and functionally outlaw it.

The Tennessee Cattlemen's Association appreciates the establishment of an Under Secretary for Trade position created in the 2014 Farm Bill. How are the bilateral agreements progressing with the countries that have been part of the TPP agreement? And many of these countries, as you know, offer significant market opportunities for U.S. beef, and I hope that under your leadership we can count on you to negotiate these bilateral agreements.","Well, certainly, the two great wins in that area is American beef back into Brazil already, already the first shipment, and I hope we will be able to announce very soon and show you a picture of U.S. beef going into China, which is a huge market. I think your cattlemen are looking forward to that. There are technical issues to continue to resolve when dealing with some of the international buyers.

14,11525545152,"I want to follow up on a question that Representative Bustos asked earlier. In my different roles in the State of Delaware, one of them was as state personnel director. When you talked about the reorganization and the realignment, I was interested specifically in the Under Secretary position for Rural Development. And I know that it is one that carries significant weight. You talked about it as well, the different responsibilities, and now pulling it closer to your office. And I just was hoping you could clarify, it is my understanding that there are many functions that the Under Secretary is legally able to perform, that a special assistant would not be able to perform. Is that correct?","I am not familiar with that. I don't know that that would have influenced my decision, had I thought that. With the Assistant Secretary reporting directly to me, I can't believe that that would be diminished. You are going to have directors in the three areas of Rural Development, with utilities service, water, and community facilities. You will still have directors in that, with the same subagency mission areas there. My expectation is that those people will continue to report to the Assistant Secretary.

So I want you to understand the relationship.    Furthermore, let me just say that the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity is something that I am very concerned about. Mr. Mulvaney, the Consumer Bureau's Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity has had many successes, including record court settlements for consumers who were illegally discriminated against in credit court mortgage and indirect lending.    You recently made changes to gut the powers and undermine the role of this critical office. Why have you stopped experts in supervision and enforcement of our lending discrimination laws from doing their jobs?","We haven't. The Fair Lending Office has a supervision and enforcement function and an education function. And, prior to the changes that I made, all of it sat within our own Supervision and Enforcement. And all we did is split it into two pieces, so that supervision and enforcement was under Supervision and Enforcement, and education was actually elevated, Congresswoman, to the director's office.

20,11389598181,"I think the understanding is the rules of the House say that Members should conduct themselves in a way that reflects credibility upon the House. I think people watching this hearing today can decide whether or not that's been followed on that.    Look, I think what you're trying to tell people at one point is that it's the Inspector General's responsibility to review this matter and file a report and, in that report, make recommendations as to what action might be done or, upon reviewing that report, you or others might make recommendations of what might be done, such as refer to a--another body like the FBI or somebody else.

22,11388494151,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Commissioner, Chairman Issa wrote a letter to you yesterday, complaining that you were guilty of a failure to comply with the committee's demands for documents. He also said, ``Your continued noncompliance with these requests also contravenes your pledge to fully cooperate with congressional investigations.'' So even though you have already produced more than 400,000 pages to the committee, even though you have 250 employees working on producing more, he accuses you of violating your pledge and frustrating congressional oversight. I think this is shameful and it is even more so when you actually look at the unbelievably broad demands the chairman has made.    Lets look at just one of these demands. Number 8 in Mr. Issa's letter, it demands the following: ``All documents referring or relating to the evaluation of tax-exempt applications or the examination of tax-exempt organizations from January 1, 2009 to August 2nd, 2013.'' Let me read that again: All documents from 2009 to 2013, nearly four years, referring or relating in any way to tax-exempt applications.    Mr. Commissioner, how broad is this request?","That request will get you not thousands, but probably millions of documents.

24,11525545069,"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. And I appreciated reading that your new motto at USDA is, ``Let's do right and feed everyone.'' I think we all hopefully share that goal.    I was a little surprised in your opening statement and in your written testimony I didn't see any mention of SNAP, which is the premiere anti-hunger program in this country. We have 42 million Americans who are food-insecure, who are hungry, many of them rely on this program to be able to put food on their table for themselves and their kids. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs we have. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at USDA who oversee and implement this program because it has one of the lowest error rates and fraud rates of any Federal program we have. We might want to consider lending some of those staff to the Department of Defense to oversee their defense contracting. They might get it better over there. But the bottom line is this is a good program. I worry because there is lots of talk, I have a bunch of articles that appeared in the last couple of weeks of Members of this body, and some people in the Administration, looking at SNAP as a place to basically try to find money to pay for other priorities; essentially, using it as an ATM machine, and that would be a mistake. We have heard talk of block granting SNAP, we have heard talk of putting more restrictions on the program, putting more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for people to be eligible for the program, which would be a mistake. The average amount of time that people are on this program is less than a year. And the benefit, I would argue, is inadequate. It is, on average, about $1.40 per person, per meal, which you can't buy a coffee for that nowadays.    My question to you is, and I am looking for some assurance here that; first, you are a strong defender of the program, that you are not advocating structural changes, or trying to put more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for poor people to get food, because it is a concern of a lot of people in this country. I would be interested in hearing your views on what you plan for SNAP?","Thank you, Congressman. I did not include that because I was hoping you would ask me the question. I thought you would. But nonetheless, I agree with all that you have said. It has been a very important, effective program. I am a continuing improvement guy; can we improve maybe the delivery and the processes and the protocols there. Yes, we have some disparity between our states of how they are implementing and executing that, and the cost over delivery, and I would like to see more unanimity in some of those delivery mechanisms, learning from the best, learning from one another about how we can deliver those programs even better. But as far as I am concerned, we have no proposed changes. You don't try to fix things that aren't broken.

Mr. Secretary, you are a veterinarian by trade, and that Pennsylvania is the home of one of the greatest veterinarian schools in the nation; University of Penn. I was just visiting that school last week. Can you share the importance of veterinarian programs that you look to strengthen as it relates to our nation?

28,11388494041,"My final question, I understand that the IRS has now completed all of the inspector general's recommendations, but, going forward, what additional plans do you have to ensure that these management problems have been fully addressed?","We have agreed with the inspector general that before any election we will conduct additional training sessions and try to sensitize all of the people reviewing applications to make sure that we handle them appropriately, no matter what the political background of any of the organizations; and this would apply to people at one end of the political spectrum or the other. That will be done before every election as we go forward.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
29,11525545003,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First of all, Mr. Secretary, I want to let you know, and I think you know this, that I very strongly support the Chairman and the cotton industry, and finding a fix for them, and so whatever you can do to help, I will be there to help as well.    The Rural Development issue has caused some consternation here and there, but I take you at your word that you are going to continue to make that a priority, you are the Secretary, you decide how the Department should be run. And the only thing I would say is we are going to watch to make sure that Rural Development gets the same kind of emphasis that it always has. And you have said that, and I expect that will happen.    And another issue that I hope you and Secretary Ross, and I think you will, keep the Mexicans' feet to the fire on the sugar issue and try to get that resolved. So far you have been doing a great job with that.    One of the things that I went through here recently, we had a High-Path AI outbreak in my district, and the Department did a great job responding to it, and the state and everybody. I have had a firsthand look at this, and it is clear that the time to start a conversation with our trade partners regarding the use of vaccines to minimize the impact of High-Path AI doesn't need to happen during the course of the outbreak. It seems like what we do, but it needs to happen at a different time. That is when the trade impacts are the most damaging.    Do you think that because of the trade impacts associated with a decision like the use of vaccines to eradicate a disease, such as a stamp-out procedure, should begin now rather than when we get into the next----?","It is wise, obviously. Sometimes, I guess, the saying we have in Georgia, ``When the mule is out the gate, it is too late to close the gate.'' You don't get that opportunity after an outbreak has occurred. You all are wise in considering a vaccine bank, whether it is foot-and-mouth disease, whether it is High-Path Avian Influenza.    I will comment on the fact that while the 2015 outbreak of High-Path we were a little slow to respond, both at the state and probably the Federal level, the outbreak that we have had in Tennessee and north Alabama this year, I was very, very impressed with the process there. The biosanitary processes and protocols that our producers have learned, the depopulation, in the speed with which USDA moved over the indemnification issues, and there was no confusion there. To their credit, that was confined very, very tightly. And that is the best kind of insurance we can have, although this Committee and Congress is very wise to consider a foot-and-mouth disease bank, maybe High-Path AI as well, because of the damage to the market psychologically. What happens whenever we have any of these outbreaks, you go back to BSE almost 15 years ago or longer, that is how long it has taken us to get beef back into some nations there. It damages the market, not just for that period of time, but it gives people a loss of confidence in our reputation of safety in the U.S.    We know that vaccination is effective, and you are wise to consider those efforts.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no
30,11388494029,You said something about relevance. Can you explain that?,"Part of the process when this started, because there are literally millions of emails, was to take a look at, in agreement with the staffs of the investigating committees, take a look at 83, ultimately it was originally a smaller number, the IRS added to the custodians as it were, that is, the people sending and receiving emails, there are 83 of those that we agreed to look at. The terms in terms of what would be relevant were determined by congressional committees, as well as the IRS, to try to limit the volume. As I say, limiting the volume, you still have 700,000 pages of relevant documents. To the extent that somebody wants to look at hundreds of thousands more pages of what the search terms defined by the Congress would be termed irrelevant, at some point we are happy to provide those. We will provide those in the orderly course.    But I will tell you that our experience is it is going to be an overwhelming volume of materials. They will take us some significant time to redact taxpayer information, a significant part of which will have nothing to do with this investigation. But if that is the way the committee wants to go, we will go that way. But the other committees, and staff of this committee in the early determinations, decided that that would be a fruitless task of overwhelming the investigators, not us, overwhelming the investigators with thousands of pages of irrelevant documents. Therefore, they suggested with us and selected with us search terms of what would be relevant: Tea Party, examinations, whatever else they picked. There are a whole series of those terms designed to limit the volume of materials.    We still have provided a lot of duplicative and probably irrelevant materials within those search terms, but we have not determined anything within those search terms. We have said if those are the terms that will help you winnow it down, we are happy to work with you. But if the committee wants to get simply large volumes of personal emails from a lot of different people, we will go through again, making sure that we redact those appropriately. As I say, we have provided unredacted copies of all of this in terms of the relevance determined by the committees to the other committees, and we provided all of the redacted information available now and we are continue to redact it. It cannot be done overnight.",100000,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no
31,11531417045,"All right.

32,11531417069,I know that you made--I was talking with some folks and there was a situation. I know that the Chairman talked a minute ago about some of the dollars that you were using. And you have some economic researchers here that--something like 40 of them--and they are able to do some self-directed research for you. And is that very productive?,"I haven't found the productivity in it yet, Congressman. We could talk about that maybe a little bit further in another question.

33,11388494039,"On page 17 of the inspector general's report he lists another recommendation: ``Provide oversight to ensure that potential political cases, some of which have been in process for three years, are approved or denied expeditiously.'' In response, the IRS chart says that this ``As of February 21st, 2014, 112 cases in the original backlog, 85 percent, have been closed.''    Commissioner, this is good news, and I understand from your testimony today that this number has gone even higher, to 87 percent. Can you please explain how this expedited review process worked? I think I have one minute left on my time.","The way that worked is Interim Commissioner Danny Werfel, who I think did a great job as the interim, established a process for expedited review, and any applicant who would simply certify that they were not going to spend more than 40 percent of their time on political activity could be approved immediately. And that streamlined process continues for new applicants. Forty-five or so of the existing at that time pending applicants filed that paper and were immediately reviewed and approved. Of those that are still pending, they have decided not to, in fact, sign the affidavit that they would not spend more than 40 percent of their time on political activity.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
34,11388494076,"He just said something, Mr. Chairman, and I want to make sure it is clear. It sounds like, Mr. Chairman, that he has an impression of what is being subpoenaed using certain lists and we have an opinion, and they don't coincide. Is that accurate?","No. I think what has happened is the subpoena that was delivered to me in February said it wanted all the emails for a set of people. What we have been trying to do is all of those people, you have emails from those people with regard to the determination process pursuant to the search terms that we have been working with. The subpoena now says we would like them all for anything. We have now finally completed, although we are still working on the redaction, all of the production of documents regarding the determination process, which is what the IG report focused on. We have said that that is the first priority we have had. We have never said we are not going to provide you the rest of the documents, and in fact, trying to figure out the most efficient way to do it, we have said we will provide you Lois Lerner emails on everything with regard to examinations, appeals, and the regulatory process as it goes forward.    And I have said when we are done with all of that, if you want to actually get emails, if you want them all, we will give them all to you, but if you want to actually take a more focused investigation on the regulatory process or otherwise, we are happy to work with you to figure how that goes. But in light of this chairman's view, as soon as we can finish the rest of these redactions and go forward, we will provide you volumes of emails, which many of them are going to be irrelevant, which is what I said in Congressman Mica's comment. Not that the materials you have are irrelevant; the ones you are likely to get in volume are irrelevant. And if you want it without any selective process, we will redact them.

And in the early years, there was quite a great deal of interest in agriculture and people returning. In fact, my father-in-law was the farm manager at the university. And it was a great deal of interest to students who were coming out. When I came up, as you say, I was in the FFA, 4-H club, and all of those areas that help you get very acquainted with farm products, growing cattle and poultry, and so forth.

So how in the world did we get to a situation where the IRS, on its own, outside of statutory authority, decided to interpret this as primarily? Because, to me, that is part of the problem. Exclusively ought to mean exclusively. And if Congress wants to change that, we should change the law. But I don't remember Congress investing IRS with the authority to actually decide to interpret it radically different, not just kind of a little fudge factor here. This is radically different. And it seems to me therein is the problem, because clearly some of these organizations are not exclusively social welfare agents, I mean, clearly, they are largely designed to be political, partisanly political, that concern the chairman has, overt partisan communication, and I share that concern. And all too many of these organizations hide under the umbrella of social welfare when in fact what they really mean is partisan political activity.

Mr. Perdue, certainly, as another fellow veterinarian, as Mr. Yoho said, we are glad to have you, as a fellow farmer we are glad to have you, and I am sure General Bacon, who is sitting right in front of me, as an Air Force veteran, is glad that he has a fellow Air Force veteran sitting in your chair. We are so happy.    We certainly look for a close relationship. And for a man that, as Governor, stood on the Capitol steps during a severe drought and prayed for rain, and then shortly thereafter addressed record flooding, I definitely want to be closer to you if things go south.    So you have answered certainly most of my questions. The Chairman had one on the cottonseed issue, and that is very near and dear to me in Louisiana. The Ranking Member brought up the State Director of Rural Development and FSA, when they would be filled. And then Mr. Crawford brought up the practical to replant issue, which hit us right between the eyes in Louisiana with the flooding last year. I appreciate you addressing all those issues.    The quick question I do want to ask is that, with furrow irrigation rice, your agency has allowed that to become an insured crop, and in Louisiana we certainly appreciate that. As you know, with the furrow irrigated rice they tend to use the blast resistant seed. And for those here that don't know what that is, it is a fungus that affects rice and just devastates yields. And if they use that seed; that blast resistant seed, production goes up, yield per acre, and certainly water usage goes down, so it is a great thing. My question is when can we expect final approval of this process to take place?","Congressman, you have me under water on your rice production right now.",001001,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no

Great man, great family, and what you will find from Sonny Perdue is, if he can help you, he will help you, and if he tells you he is going to do something, he is going to do it, and I have always appreciated that from you.    And, Governor, just a couple of quick comments and questions maybe. I was at the USDA research station in Byron this last week. As you know, research is not something that you can simply cut on and off; it is a long-term commitment, it is a long-term investment, and that investment has to be coupled with extension for it to actually get to the fields and help the farmers and our economy. And so they brought up while I was there the hiring freeze, and certainly hope that as we go forward we are able to come out from underneath that hiring freeze, and that you have the flexibility to put the people in the most effective areas with regard to research, and that that partnership will be there with the states, I know under you for the extension to actually get that research to the field.    Your commitment to 4-H, your commitment to FFA is something that also those two organizations are extremely important to rural America, and I know that those organizations will benefit from you being in that position as well.    One of the things that has changed on the farm in the last couple of years, and is changing at an exponential rate, is the use of technology. We know that President Trump will have an infrastructure program that will be put forward. The rural broadband, as you know, we need that, quite honestly, more than we need roads and bridges in many of the counties that I represent. You know from growing up in Houston County, you have metropolitan areas and then just a few miles down the road you have areas like you grew up in, in Bonaire, and I lived in Ashburn for a long time. I tell people I live in Tifton now but I actually live in Chula, Georgia. And so if you could just speak to the rural broadband issue, and any assistance that you believe that the USDA can give us with making sure that the rural broadband is a part of President Trump's infrastructure package? I would appreciate your comments on that.","I would be happy to, friend. First of all, let me talk about research just a second because you mentioned that. And you are absolutely right, the reason our producers are so productive today in the 21st century is because of the research and the foundation that has been laid. It is not something that can be cut off and on. And the other thing is the delivery system of that basic and applied research to the field through the extension service has been the wonder of the world, and we see what difference it has made in our productivity, and will continue to need to be as we have to feed nine billion people by 2050.    That is important, but you made a great point, another thing that is just as important is the technology, because you know your producers in middle and south Georgia are using technology for better water usage, better technology for precision agriculture, for monitoring crop needs; whether it is whatever adding, and the telemetry that is needed out there is dependent on wireless technology and WiFi. The other thing sociologically, Congressman, in today's world of connectivity, it might be true in your house with Wells' age, if the water goes off that is kind of a disadvantage, if your lights go off, oh, bummer, if your heat goes off you will get a blanket, but if your WiFi goes off that is a crisis. And that is kind of what happens out there in the world today is we are not sociologically, to Congressman Scott's point, we are not going to keep these young people on the farm attracted there if they don't have the connectivity they are used to when they go to college. They are not going to come back. And it is vitally important. The good news is this is square on the radar scope of the President, as well as the FCC Chairman. I have had conversations with him. He is anxiously awaiting the infrastructure plan where we can ambitiously take rural broadband ubiquitously across the country. As you know, there are places in our home state you can't even get a cell signal.    We have a lot of challenges, but I am convinced of what you hit on, it is the modern-day road, sewer, water of the 21st century is connectivity. And I look forward to promulgating as much of that as we can across the country.",101000,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no
63,11525545139,"Secretary Perdue, thanks for being here. I feel a kindred spirit being a fellow veterinarian. And I don't know whether to call you Doc, Governor, or Secretary. If you are like me, you probably prefer Doc. And I look forward to helping you achieve your mission.    The way you opened up, and everything you have said I am in alignment. And it just sounds like you have common sense. I can only feel that comes from working on the south end of a horse or a cow in your past. But what you were talking about, I look forward to helping you achieve your goal of making a realignment of the USDA to make it the most efficient agency in government. And that is such a critical thing, knowing the debt that our country is facing, we have to do more with less, and I look forward to working with you on that.    And you also talked about the USDA stamp, it should be revered and trusted, and I agree, because that stamp around the world stands for the highest quality product that you can get, and it is so important that we protect it.    And several of the things I wanted to talk about were already talked about. Your understanding of FMD, it is music to my ears. There was a point up here where it wasn't talked about much, and we know the threat. We haven't had that here since 1929. If it comes here, it would be devastating. And certainly, we know what happened with BSE with the three cases that were here, and how long it is just now taking us to recover after 15 years. And that was with no depopulation of any of the herds. And certainly, if we had an FMD outbreak, it would be devastating. It would take years and years to recover, not just our cattle herd but our trade.    And as we look forward, I look forward to working with you on the new farm bill to make continued improvements in the cotton program, as was talked, but not at the expense of other crops, i.e., peanuts. I come from north central Florida, and the cottonseed program is something we talked about, to help give diversification to the cotton growers. And that is something that I hope you would consider looking at. But what we know is with these programs, you can't have one at the expense of the other one. And with peanuts, we certainly know within that one program you have discrepancy because you have the people that have generic and/or base acres, and then you have people that have neither, and they are growing peanuts right next to each other. One is at a disadvantage because they don't fall into a program. And we have seen people switch from cotton to grow peanuts because of the farm program. And there are some things that can be fixed in that, and I hope you will look at that. And not to penalize anybody, just to give that, I guess, parity on one peanut field to the next so that those farmers can stay in business, especially the young farmers that we see.    We have several things that we have put together. What I would like to do is having a meeting with you and maybe your staff, and go over some of the things.    And then coming from Florida, we have over 360 specialty crops in Florida. Florida is known for number one in the nation for melons, sweet corn, and citrus. Even with citrus greening, as Mr. Soto brought up, we went from 470 million boxes, we are down to under 70 million boxes. It is something that has to be dealt with, and we look forward to the robust funding that USDA has done.    And I guess one of my asks for you is, the research and development that we are doing is so vitally important, and again, USDA has been great on this, that we take that research and development, because we know one of the cures is probably going to be a GMO tree, to have the USDA help in marketing those products. And that is something I would like to see USDA get involved now to move to where we can start marketing that stuff.    Do you have any thoughts about that?","Well, you mentioned several things. Let me think of that and then I can address your final question. But certainly, from the vigilance over foot-and-mouth, as well as any other disease, Congressman, you know that we thought we were done with screwworms, and yet we have these things break out, and very quickly contained, but you have to be vigilant every day.",001101,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
64,11389598095,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Like Mr. Mica, John Koskinen, I have known you well before you came to Congress. Since coming to Congress, I have been impressed, not a little bit, by the confidence you have inspired in Republican and Democratic Presidents alike. It's as if they saved you for jobs that others couldn't do, didn't have the guts to do, or didn't have the integrity to do. You are well-known on both sides of the aisle as the government's most versatile turnaround artist. When an agency is in trouble, turn to John Koskinen.    Therefore, I begin my series of questions simply by offering you an apology. I believe you deserve one. You deserve one because of accusations designed to sacrifice the reputation of a public servant with a spotless reputation, for political advantage, without a scintilla--and I use my words advisedly--of evidence.    It's vile enough to look a man in the face and accuse him of perjury without submitting any evidence. It is much worse when all of the evidence supports the version of the facts of the man you are facing. Whether it is that the Lerner crash occurred well before this investigation began--she must be clairvoyant; whether it's been confirmed by the decriminalization lab, all the evidence is on your side, Mr. Koskinen.    And I want to point out for the record that the line of conspiracy hunting has shifted with the Lerner crash. For the longest time, the line of questioning was about one subject alone. So we've moved from one scapegoat to another. What we've just moved off of, the notion that this was all a conspiracy directed on behalf of the White House, that also without a crumb of evidence. Lacking evidence, the crash provides new fodder.    Just for the record, Mr. Koskinen, have you identified any evidence since you have been Commissioner that IRS employees before you came or now were part of a conspiracy to intentionally target the President's political enemies?","No. I have done no investigations. I have read the IG's report that said inappropriate criteria were used to identify organizations for review. And the IG had nine recommendations, and we have accepted all of those recommendations.    I think it's important for the public to be confident that, whoever they are, they're going to be treated fairly by the IRS, whether they're Republicans, Democrats, belong to organizations of one kind or another. Wherever they show up, wherever they speak, they should understand they'll be treated fairly. If there's an issue, it's because something in their tax return; if somebody else had that issue, they would get the same response from the IRS.

I just want to echo the concerns of the Chairman in regards to the problems that we are facing in cotton country. We are behind you by one, we are number three in cotton and Georgia is number two, and the Chairman will claim credit for Texas being number one in cotton production, but we are all in this together. And cotton producers need relief, and they need it yesterday. And, when we start to lose our gin infrastructure, as the old saying goes, ``You can cut down an oak tree in 5 minutes but it takes a long time to grow it back.'' And so as we start to see our ginning infrastructure disappear it is going to have an impact on our rural economies, and in the broader sense on our economy and state in general. I hope that, as you have indicated, and I am sure you will, use every tool at your disposal to help us address that issue of the cotton producers belt-wide?","Thank you, sir.

And then the final thing is, several stakeholders are contacting me about your reorganization plans for replacing the USDA Under Secretary for Rural Development, and what can you do, and are you listening to their fears, are you listening to them, and what are you doing to alleviate some of those fears?","The fears are that the proof is in the pudding, and will it be held accountable. We have talked about it a good bit in here this morning about how I view it as an elevation with influence and access in Rural Development, rather than just a title. It is unfortunate that the media chose to portray it as a diminishment of the importance of Rural Development, and that is not the case. We are doing everything we can to persuade people and, again, we are willing to be shown, I am an output kind of guy, so wait and watch and see what I do.

79,11388494108,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Koskinen, what part of all don't you and the IRS understand? You have said like ten times now if you give us all Lois Lerner's emails, we are going to get irrelevant information. Frankly, with all due respect, we don't care what you think is irrelevant. The committee has asked for every single--I asked for it clear back in August from Danny Werfel and he told me the same thing you did; we are trying, we are hoping, we are going to get there someday, sometime. We want them all. Because if you limit it to what you said earlier, to determinations, appeals, exams, and rulemaking, just those categories, what if there is an email to Lois Lerner from the White House that says, Hey, Lois, keep up the great work, we appreciate what you are doing? What if there is that kind of email? That wouldn't fit under the categories and the search terms that you are talking about. When we say all, we want every single email in the time period in the subpoena that was sent to you, plain and simple.    Now, let me ask you this. You agree with the TIGTA audit report that came out, you agree there were problems and you are trying to comply with the TIGTA audit report, is that accurate, Mr. Koskinen?",That is correct.,100000,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no
80,11389598138,"Right.    That's why it's so important, getting to what Jim Jordan has said about a special prosecutor, and that's what my question is to you today.    If you are truly a man of integrity and you know the difference between you--you--there's no--that you have--you don't have any evidence that a crime has been committed versus you know no crime has been committed, you have to understand that the whole integrity of your Agency is at risk.    You possibly have people at the IRS who are committing crimes and they're not being held accountable. The only way you can know that is to--by pick up the phone, call the FBI and ask them to come in and do an investigation on the disappearance of these emails.    So my question to you is: Will you call the FBI and ask them to come in and investigate these missing emails that their destruction could possibly have been a crime?","At this time, the Inspector General, an independent agency not controlled by us, started an investigation----",001100,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no
81,11389598012,"Well, what is correct?","What is correct is that each employee is limited to basically now 6,000 emails that they can hold on their email account which is stored on the agency's server.    The reason there is a limitation is the agency does not have servers large enough to sustain the retention of all emails. A decision was made 2 years ago when people looked at that and it was determined it would cost anywhere from $10 million to $30 million to upgrade the system so that, in fact, all emails on the server would be preserved. Because of the budget constraints the agency was operating with 2 years ago, the decision was made not to proceed.",100000,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

Not all the emails you believe are responsive, not all the emails you choose to give, not all the emails that are other than embarrassing; all the emails.","Mr. Chairman, we are prepared to continue to work with your staff.

She is at the heart of most of this activity. It was pointed out by Mr. Jordan that she concocted it was almost a Hollywood production before the inspector general, May 14th, came out with his report to blame the people in Cincinnati, some rogue IRS employees who gathered around the water cooler and concocted a scheme to again target. And I think she laid that out, is that not correct?    I mean, historically, you know that as a fact.

And I would like to offer an invitation to you to come see the locks and dam system along the Mississippi River. That is the entire western border of my district is the Mississippi, and seeing the locks and dams that were built in the 1930s that really need a lot of attention. But we would love to have you come and visit us, so consider that an invitation.    Quickly shifting gears, yesterday the Joint Economic Committee released a report outlining many of the economic challenges in rural America, which I would like to have entered into the record. But I would also like to acknowledge something that Congresswoman Fudge said earlier, that I am concerned about the Trump Administration budget that calls for a 21 percent cut in USDA, including eliminating Rural Development's water infrastructure programs, and the Rural Business--Cooperative Service. Just a big concern. And that can be echoed, you will probably hear some other questions from my colleagues here. But the reorganization also eliminates the Rural Development mission area entirely, as well as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary, which you have addressed for a moment. But it is my understanding that you have already submitted the reorganization plan to Congress for the mandatory 30 day notification period, however, just today, you sought public comment through a Federal Register notice on the proposal. I was wondering about the formal reorganization plan sent to Congress, why that was presented to Congress before seeking feedback from the impacted stakeholders. Just your thought on kind of that order of that?","I am not sure I can answer that question specifically, other than that I have given my vision, and we are progressing in the protocol, as I understand it, directed by our General Counsel to implement this. I visited with your Chairman and Ranking Member here, the Chairman and Ranking Member of Ag Appropriations to let them know of my plans and to do that. I may not be as attuned to the Federal requirements of permission as they are, but all I know is my heartbeat is to make good and to do well, and to make sure USDA continues to serve the best way.

And the whole focus on trade really sparked my interest, and given your high priority on enhancing trade opportunities in the U.S. agricultural products, can you share with the Committee your views on FAS programs like the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops, and the MAP, Market Access Program? Do you support these programs remaining as critical tools in USDA's trade toolbox?","Absolutely. Your represented state, it is understood in your poultry industry how much export and how much trade affects that. The good news is we have a poultry ecosystem in this nation; Delaware, Georgia, Arkansas, and across the country, that is just unable to be replicated, from the feed grains and the processing and the growing, and it is a great blessing to do that.    All these tools, we have to have those tools and more available because our producers are going to challenge us. They can grow it, they have demonstrated they can grow it, and the challenge would be to feed that hungry world with trade and export.

88,11389598045,How does that affect what you do?,"What it affects is that--we have a wide range of responsibilities. The IT budget has been cut by over $100 million over the last 4 years. This year's budget for 2014 required $300 million just for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but Congress provided us zero. That meant that that $300 million to implement a statutory mandate had to be taken from other IT programs.

It is a real challenge, but most of the challenge comes from the countercyclical culture of growth. I mean they are lower in the hemisphere than we are, and can grow things different seasonally in that way. But we have to make sure that the safety of those products is just what we insist on in our American producers as well.    And as regarding NAFTA negotiations, my hope and my advocacy will be that we don't go backward in that.

To touch on one other point that my colleagues have talked about already, in concept, the NRCS, the FSA, and the RMA coordination could improve by being under a single mission area of farm production and conservation. And I am particularly sensitive about these issues because my district was ground zero in the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. And part of why, in the drought of the 1950s, and the drought that we went through in the early part of this decade, things were so dramatically different were all of those conservation efforts properly practiced out there, encouraged by the NRCS and the predecessors of the Soil Conservation Service. How will you ensure that that conservation mission will not be diminished in any way under this new management program, and that the voluntary incentive-based conservation, which is the way we have practiced it since the 1930s, will continue to be the highest priority of the Department?","It is a good question. Mission has no change at all. Personnel, no change. All we are doing is trying to bring the family together where we can communicate better to serving that same customer, whether they are signing up for a farm program, an ARC, PLC, or EQIP or other things there, to come in. I view it as an economy of scale issue. If you have NRCS in one area, and you have FSA, and they have two people in the office and one of them out, our customers are suffering. If you have four people there, that is a little bit better economy of scale to serve people.    We are really talking about the same customers. Now, from a family perspective, how do we communicate, when farmers and ranchers walk into those offices I want to say, whoever greets them, how can we help you today, not, that is not my job. And that is the purpose of the realignment. We will learn better to communicate, we will learn better the real needs of the farm rancher customer that walks in the door, helping to do a farm plan for them. If they are signing up for one thing and we are right there, then we can say, well, let's do an NRCS waterway program that way, and help them be more aware of all the things NRCS can do.    I agree with you, the technology of better water, cleaner water, we are making great strides in. Our farm community is really understanding their stewardship ability, or really opportunity, better than they ever had. They now understand they are responsible for that off-flow off their farms, and they want to do the things. NRCS is critical in enabling them, teaching them, educating them how to do that.    There will be no change in the mission. We are realigning, in a closer family atmosphere where we can have a critical mass to help people better.",100000,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

When you go home tomorrow or the next day, you might want to see Congresswoman Duckworth asking him how his ankle that he hurt at the prep school feels, because, in fact, he claimed to be a disabled veteran some 27 years later. And his old college buddy, a lifelong friend, helped him get that contract.    At that time and now, we rely on the ability to recover emails as part of the chain of discovery. TIGTA Russell George, your IG, relies on that. Tomorrow we'll hear from the head of the National Archives, the Archivist. He relies on your organization to comply with Federal law.

The director denied that when I asked him about it during one appearance before this committee, but the simple truth of the matter is that taking enforcement actions against a firm when no rule or guidance has been issued is, in actuality, regulation by enforcement. In fact, I could give you an example of the BCF fining an entity based on they were thinking about proposing a rule.    In your January memo to the staff, you suggest that the days of regulation by enforcement were coming to an end. You wrote, ``When it comes to enforcement, we will focus on quantifiable and unavoidable harm to the consumer.'' Can you tell us about your goals for enforcement, and how you--and what do you believe the Bureau's enforcement authorities--how they should be used?","Yes, sir. Regulation by enforcement is done.

I want to start with a quick question, I hope, and then go into something a little more in-depth. To start with, our aging locks and dam system. There is $37 billion in agriculture and food products that flow through the Illinois ports and waterways. Upgrading aging locks and dams on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers is a top priority for the growers that I represent in my region. Congress has authorized these upgrades, but the Administration has to request the funding. And what I would ask of you, if you can answer with a yes or no that would be appreciated, but can we count on you to push this Administration to invest in our water infrastructure, and specifically, will you push for 1,200-foot locks on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in the President's infrastructure plan?","Yes, in the broad answer. Specifically, on the 1,200-foot dam, we will look at that and see. I was at the White House yesterday for an infrastructure meeting, and let me tell you that inland waterways is right at the top of their list over the contribution to the economy. We know how important it is to the ag economy. I was on the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati the other day and saw some of those barge-loading facilities. It is a huge advantage for the U.S. economy, and producers especially. We have other parts in the world in South America that might compete with us production-wise, but they don't have the infrastructure. That wonderful river network that runs through your state and all through the middle of our nation is a vital resource for the world economy. If there is anything we can do, I commit to being a serious advocate for American agriculture.

It is home to the National Tennessee Walking Horse Celebration, with a nationwide economic impact of approximately $3.2 billion. The Tennessee Walking Horse industry directly or indirectly employs over 20,000 people in largely rural areas in farming communities where economic hardship is commonplace. The previous Administration obstructed progress and refused to cooperate with the industry to develop scientific inspection methods to replace the current subjective methods that were prone to error. Can folks in Tennessee count on you to be supportive of the Walking Horse industry, and facilitate scientific and objective inspection methods to eliminate soring so that people can continue to enjoy this time-honored tradition?","Certainly. I would love to comment on that. As you know, we have delayed that rule in order that we can get the facts about that. Beautiful horses, beautiful animals, but we have to balance that with our humane treatment. That is what APHIS does. For the reputation of the wonderful people in the Walking Horse industry, they want the bad actors out as much as anyone does. That is what we hope to have as a regulatory protocol that will ensure how the enforcement operates in that, how that is done, best assures the public that these animals are not being treated inhumanely in order for them to perform.

111,11388494119,"Okay. Well, this is put out by the Exempt Organizations Division, same division where all these problems took place over the last three years. It came out, again, just five days after the comment period on the proposed rule ended at the end of February, and I want to just highlight a few of the questions that are asked. So there is a category that says what if the IRS needs more information about your (c)(4) application? New sample questions. So if we could put them up side-by-side.    Now, the first slide are the targeted questions that TIGTA said were inappropriate and that you agree are inappropriate, Judith Kendall agreed are inappropriate. Those are those questions. And now, just five days after the proposed rule comment period ends, you issue a newsletter from the Exempt Organizations Division highlighting the new questions you are going to ask, and I just want to look how similar the two questions are.    Let's just take the second category, whether an officer or director, etcetera, has run or will run for public office. The new question says this: Do you support a candidate for public office who is one of your founders, officers, or board members? It is basically the same. This reminds me of when I was in grade school and the teachers told us you shouldn't plagiarize, so you change a few words and basically plagiarize. This is the same thing.    So here is what I don't understand. If you are trying to comply with the TIGTA report, if the new (c)(4) rule is a way to deal with what the audit said and not as what I believe is a continuation of the project Lois Lerner started, why are you asking the same darn questions?","As I noted, I haven't seen that and can't read it on the chart. I would be delighted to sit down and go over all of those questions with you and with the exempt organizations. All of the TIGTA report didn't blanket say you should never ask questions about this. Thank you for the chart.",001011,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no

113,11531417067,"When you are looking at that rule, are you going to be looking at the access to credit for small-dollar needs of consumers as something that would be a priority to see how you can continue to allow the markets to provide that opportunity for people who want to take advantage of it?    And then also, the cost benefit of allowing that to happen in a certain way, or whatever the rules--however they are, is this--these are two important points, I think.","We would be looking at anything that is relevant to an ordinary rulemaking, and those things are absolutely part of those--part of that data.",100000,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no

Will you commit to deliver all of those emails, redacted only for 6103?","Yes. As I said, we have never said we wouldn't produce those emails.

So when you all are going through these emails, the last part of what you said is very significant. You said something about they have to be relevant. I mean, where are you getting all of that from? You remember what you just said, the last part of it? It sounded like there were certain things that were used, terms that were used to decide what you think is responsive to the subpoena.

119,11525545128,"California is number one in medium grade. Thank you for meeting the California folks earlier this week as well too; for rice. We just need a little more help in the exports on that, getting more of that product into Japan. There was a lot of disappointment over the TPP with only opening up another 50,000 tons, which I and about seven other growers could grow that ourselves. That didn't mean a whole lot, so maybe as that comes back around, we can see a little more entry for rice as well as other exports.    Last, I would just like to hear what you think on this. We did hear a little mention of SNAP earlier. We have had a lot of hearings on that during this last year. Very comprehensive. And it keeps coming up the issue of SNAP, which is a program this Committee very strongly supports, but the way it is targeted, and there are a lot of issues with some of the products SNAP is being used for; soda and candy, and things like that, that aren't generally healthy, where the original intent was ag products that come from here. Could you just touch in general on what you feel the direction should be with SNAP, and what kind of products we should be using with that? Thank you.","Well, our desire as parents and grandparents is that the people who take advantage of SNAP would use them for healthy food products. That is the balance: on what level do we want to become a nanny state of directing how, and what, people feed their families. That is the challenge for that. And I probably lean more to the laissez-faire rather than a prescriptive in that area, from a perspective of not wanting, if parents and people who use the SNAP benefits are not doing that at home, I don't know that we can corral them enough with restrictions in SNAP to make them do that. It is a really dicey issue of how we do that. We try to do it through education and through examples, and allowing SNAP to be used at local farmers' markets and making sure in our school program that the free vegetables and fruits are there so our kids can get used to that, and hopefully won't ask Mom and Dad for more of the other than they would healthy things. Someone mentioned earlier, and I wanted to comment on it then, but we have a serious obesity problem in our youth. How do we not only get a good nutrition program, but how do we get a good activity program going as well.

123,11388494050,"Again, this committee, it is nice to be here for a while because you see how people try to throw people under the bus. Whether it is the chairman, Mr. Cummings said the case is closed. We started our investigation on June 9th. In May we started. June 9th Mr. Cummings, the ranking member, said it appears the case is closed. And then June 9th--well, he said I see the case is solved. If it were me, I would wrap this case up and move on, to be frank. So he tries to throw the case under the bus. He tried to throw the chairman under the bus. He sent a letter just before that: Your actions over the past three years do not reflect a responsible bipartisan approach to investigations.    Now, he has a constitutional and a House responsibility for investigations and oversight. You have a responsibility to provide us with information.

And I know that the Chairman started out with that, but farmers in my state are telling me that they can't make it through another year without some relief from somewhere. I can't overemphasize how important this is because, as you know, Secretary, once we lose that cotton infrastructure, you just can't go back and re-get it there. And so I just want to make sure that you are going to explore all the options that you can to work with us, to take care of our cotton farmers so that we don't lose the ability to produce cotton in the future?","I will commit to you to do that. Certainly, the disappointment in the latest budget issues was kind of a tough slug for us because it limits my opportunities, limits my ability extremely there. But I have committed to the Chairman, you know that he is concerned about that, to do anything we can from the USDA to help relieve that.",110000,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no
125,11525545035,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Again, welcome, Mr. Secretary, and we look forward to working with you. And you, like myself and many of us here, reflect generations of farm families, and we obviously welcome you to this important effort as we look at reauthorizing the farm bill.    I don't want to repeat what has been discussed already; Farm Credit, crop insurance, cotton, and dairy, but I would like to focus on some California issues specifically.    As the number one agricultural state, the diversity and the breadth and the width, we take great pride in the production in California, and I know you are aware of it. My California colleagues and I here on the dais would like to invite you sooner rather than later to come out to California where we could have a conversation with our farmers, ranchers, dairymen and women, and talk about the complexity of California agriculture.    Speaking of which, we worked very hard in the last farm bill to provide the opportunity for the California dairy industry to participate in the Federal Marketing Order. We have completed the process of the due diligence. USDA is moving on this Milk Marketing Order. I would like to get your thoughts on the current timeline, and can we tackle this final rule before the end of 2017? As you know, the quota issue, if you haven't been briefed on it, is a key part of whether or not the dairy producers will provide a 2/3 vote to join the Federal Marketing Order.","Certainly, Congressman, I would be happy to answer as best I can. I will admit to you that even when we were in the dairy business, I am not sure I ever understood the Marketing Orders, but I hope to understand it better, going forward.    Back to your original question about diversity of agriculture in California.

How do you seek to address food insecurity and food deserts?","Well, again, some of the programs that you all have funded that we have the opportunity to award some grants regarding fresh vegetables and others, it is a healthy food program, FINI is one of them in that area, as well as another one that has to deal with those problems. There is very little money in that, frankly, but we have used pilot projects to understand how we can make sure that those people in the areas where food is not readily available have access, be it local farmers' markets or other ways, and certainly to be able to use their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to access those.

You have also said that you are taking a ``new approach'' at the Bureau. Does your new approach involve bringing any actual enforcement actions, or are you telling me that every single financial institution in America has suddenly snapped into full compliance with every single consumer financial law since you took over last November? Because that would be the first time in history that that has happened.    So what is your explanation? There has been no enforcement law, no law that has been violated, no abuse of consumers in the last 5 months?","Actually, nothing could be further from the truth, Congresswoman. We have--actively litigating 25 cases, which includes continuing to litigate things that were filed before I was there.
