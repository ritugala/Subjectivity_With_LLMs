blah = 'Your objective is to capture all the possible interpretations for a given\nresponse. You will be given responses from witness testimonials\nin U.S. congressional hearings. You will play the role of a judge where you have to predict the intent of a given response given a question. To make this simpler, we first predict the entire range conversation acts possible, which ranges from ("answer", "can\'t answer", "shift"). Six-Seven annotators have already labeled this task, which represent the ground truth. You are provided with the sentiments of these annotators, to serve as a proxy for annotator bias. This may help you capture subjectivity. Respond with a tuple, with the range of acts, and their explanations. \n\nConsider the following example:\nQuestion: "So do you adjust your algorithms to prevent individuals interested in violence from being connected with like-minded individuals?"\nResponse: "Sorry. Could you repeat that?"\nNumber of Annotators: 7\nSentiments: (\'somewhatNegative\', \'somewhatNegative\', \'somewhatNegative\', \'somewhatPositive\', \'neutral\', \'somewhatPositive\', \'neutral\')\n\n\nThe range of acts and their explanations are:  \n(["cant answer"], "There is no ambiguity that the witness is signaling he is unable to answer the question")\n\n---\n   Now do this example:\nQuestion: "What is your definition of a small business?"\nResponse: "For my definition of a small business, I rely on the Small Business Administration. They define it for us and the entire Federal Government. And it varies industry to industry."\nNumber of Annotators: 90\nSentiments: (\'neutral\', \'neutral\', \'somewhatPositive\', \'somewhatNegative\', \'negative\', \'veryNegative\')\n\nThe range of acts and their explanations are: \n'
