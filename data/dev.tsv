Now, I won't ask you to speculate, but I think some might speculate either people don't think that Mr. Camp could do the job, which I would sort of think is suspect--he's been known to be a pretty good Member--or that there's some sort of competition going on here.

But I am also concerned about, have we simply eviscerated traditional foundational principles of checks and balances and due process.

With the Assistant Secretary reporting directly to me, I can't believe that that would be diminished. You are going to have directors in the three areas of Rural Development, with utilities service, water, and community facilities. You will still have directors in that, with the same subagency mission areas there. My expectation is that those people will continue to report to the Assistant Secretary. If their powers or influence or ability to operate are diminished, we will just have to figure out how we resolve that.	I want to follow up on a question that Representative Bustos asked earlier. In my different roles in the State of Delaware, one of them was as state personnel director. When you talked about the reorganization and the realignment, I was interested specifically in the Under Secretary position for Rural Development. And I know that it is one that carries significant weight. You talked about it as well, the different responsibilities, and now pulling it closer to your office. And I just was hoping you could clarify, it is my understanding that there are many functions that the Under Secretary is legally able to perform, that a special assistant would not be able to perform.

11531417051	110000	We haven't. The Fair Lending Office has a supervision and enforcement function and an education function. And, prior to the changes that I made, all of it sat within our own Supervision and Enforcement. And all we did is split it into two pieces, so that supervision and enforcement was under Supervision and Enforcement, and education was actually elevated, Congresswoman, to the director's office. So we actually put them in more of a prestigious position in the office than existed beforehand.	Let me just say to you that you couldn't implement a thing unless, first of all, there was legislation that was passed to deal with what you are doing; and, second, that we have the responsibility for oversight for your implementation.

So even though you have already produced more than 400,000 pages to the committee, even though you have 250 employees working on producing more, he accuses you of violating your pledge and frustrating congressional oversight.

11525545069	100000	Thank you, Congressman. I did not include that because I was hoping you would ask me the question. I thought you would. But nonetheless, I agree with all that you have said. It has been a very important, effective program. I am a continuing improvement guy; can we improve maybe the delivery and the processes and the protocols there. Yes, we have some disparity between our states of how they are implementing and executing that, and the cost over delivery, and I would like to see more unanimity in some of those delivery mechanisms, learning from the best, learning from one another about how we can deliver those programs even better. But as far as I am concerned, we have no proposed changes. You don't try to fix things that aren't broken. And when the motto is, ``Do right and feed everyone,'' I view that as very, very inclusive.	Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for being here. And I appreciated reading that your new motto at USDA is, ``Let's do right and feed everyone.'' I think we all hopefully share that goal.    I was a little surprised in your opening statement and in your written testimony I didn't see any mention of SNAP, which is the premiere anti-hunger program in this country. We have 42 million Americans who are food-insecure, who are hungry, many of them rely on this program to be able to put food on their table for themselves and their kids. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs we have. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women who work at USDA who oversee and implement this program because it has one of the lowest error rates and fraud rates of any Federal program we have. We might want to consider lending some of those staff to the Department of Defense to oversee their defense contracting. They might get it better over there. But the bottom line is this is a good program. I worry because there is lots of talk, I have a bunch of articles that appeared in the last couple of weeks of Members of this body, and some people in the Administration, looking at SNAP as a place to basically try to find money to pay for other priorities; essentially, using it as an ATM machine, and that would be a mistake. We have heard talk of block granting SNAP, we have heard talk of putting more restrictions on the program, putting more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for people to be eligible for the program, which would be a mistake. The average amount of time that people are on this program is less than a year. And the benefit, I would argue, is inadequate. It is, on average, about $1.40 per person, per meal, which you can't buy a coffee for that nowadays.    My question to you is, and I am looking for some assurance here that; first, you are a strong defender of the program, that you are not advocating structural changes, or trying to put more hurdles in place to make it more difficult for poor people to get food, because it is a concern of a lot of people in this country.

11525545003	100000	It is wise, obviously. Sometimes, I guess, the saying we have in Georgia, ``When the mule is out the gate, it is too late to close the gate.'' You don't get that opportunity after an outbreak has occurred. You all are wise in considering a vaccine bank, whether it is foot-and-mouth disease, whether it is High-Path Avian Influenza.    I will comment on the fact that while the 2015 outbreak of High-Path we were a little slow to respond, both at the state and probably the Federal level, the outbreak that we have had in Tennessee and north Alabama this year, I was very, very impressed with the process there. The biosanitary processes and protocols that our producers have learned, the depopulation, in the speed with which USDA moved over the indemnification issues, and there was no confusion there. To their credit, that was confined very, very tightly. And that is the best kind of insurance we can have, although this Committee and Congress is very wise to consider a foot-and-mouth disease bank, maybe High-Path AI as well, because of the damage to the market psychologically. What happens whenever we have any of these outbreaks, you go back to BSE almost 15 years ago or longer, that is how long it has taken us to get beef back into some nations there. It damages the market, not just for that period of time, but it gives people a loss of confidence in our reputation of safety in the U.S.    We know that vaccination is effective, and you are wise to consider those efforts.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    First of all, Mr. Secretary, I want to let you know, and I think you know this, that I very strongly support the Chairman and the cotton industry, and finding a fix for them, and so whatever you can do to help, I will be there to help as well.    The Rural Development issue has caused some consternation here and there, but I take you at your word that you are going to continue to make that a priority, you are the Secretary, you decide how the Department should be run. And the only thing I would say is we are going to watch to make sure that Rural Development gets the same kind of emphasis that it always has. And you have said that, and I expect that will happen.    And another issue that I hope you and Secretary Ross, and I think you will, keep the Mexicans' feet to the fire on the sugar issue and try to get that resolved. So far you have been doing a great job with that.    One of the things that I went through here recently, we had a High-Path AI outbreak in my district, and the Department did a great job responding to it, and the state and everybody. I have had a firsthand look at this, and it is clear that the time to start a conversation with our trade partners regarding the use of vaccines to minimize the impact of High-Path AI doesn't need to happen during the course of the outbreak. It seems like what we do, but it needs to happen at a different time. That is when the trade impacts are the most damaging.

11525545055	100000	Again, any valid insurance program, whether it is crop insurance or any other insurance program, has to reflect the reality of risk there. That is what insurance is all about. As I said, as we continue to perfect the insurance program, because I agree with you, and as you well know, credit in these economic times is getting more tight, lenders are requiring an insurance product, maybe forward contracting as well, so that the producers can demonstrate repayment ability. And as we go through there, yes, I agree that it ought to be commensurate with risk. That is a tough issue, how do we do that individually, or by county or by region, in a way to do that. That is why reporting is so important for our farmers. The Census is so important for our farmers and producers to make sure we have accurate data that we can make good, wise actuarial decisions on.	Yes, I will go with that.    Let me shift subjects just a little bit, there has been a little discussion here on crop insurance, and I want the record to show that I absolutely support crop insurance. It is the essential component for risk management. And if we don't have crop insurance, we lose perhaps generations, especially young farmers. And so it is essential to keep our family farms on the farm, the ones we have left.    I will just ask the question this way.

11388494029	100000	Part of the process when this started, because there are literally millions of emails, was to take a look at, in agreement with the staffs of the investigating committees, take a look at 83, ultimately it was originally a smaller number, the IRS added to the custodians as it were, that is, the people sending and receiving emails, there are 83 of those that we agreed to look at. The terms in terms of what would be relevant were determined by congressional committees, as well as the IRS, to try to limit the volume. As I say, limiting the volume, you still have 700,000 pages of relevant documents. To the extent that somebody wants to look at hundreds of thousands more pages of what the search terms defined by the Congress would be termed irrelevant, at some point we are happy to provide those. We will provide those in the orderly course.    But I will tell you that our experience is it is going to be an overwhelming volume of materials. They will take us some significant time to redact taxpayer information, a significant part of which will have nothing to do with this investigation. But if that is the way the committee wants to go, we will go that way. But the other committees, and staff of this committee in the early determinations, decided that that would be a fruitless task of overwhelming the investigators, not us, overwhelming the investigators with thousands of pages of irrelevant documents. Therefore, they suggested with us and selected with us search terms of what would be relevant: Tea Party, examinations, whatever else they picked. There are a whole series of those terms designed to limit the volume of materials.    We still have provided a lot of duplicative and probably irrelevant materials within those search terms, but we have not determined anything within those search terms. We have said if those are the terms that will help you winnow it down, we are happy to work with you. But if the committee wants to get simply large volumes of personal emails from a lot of different people, we will go through again, making sure that we redact those appropriately. As I say, we have provided unredacted copies of all of this in terms of the relevance determined by the committees to the other committees, and we provided all of the redacted information available now and we are continue to redact it.

11388494039	100000	The way that worked is Interim Commissioner Danny Werfel, who I think did a great job as the interim, established a process for expedited review, and any applicant who would simply certify that they were not going to spend more than 40 percent of their time on political activity could be approved immediately. And that streamlined process continues for new applicants. Forty-five or so of the existing at that time pending applicants filed that paper and were immediately reviewed and approved. Of those that are still pending, they have decided not to, in fact, sign the affidavit that they would not spend more than 40 percent of their time on political activity.	On page 17 of the inspector general's report he lists another recommendation: ``Provide oversight to ensure that potential political cases, some of which have been in process for three years, are approved or denied expeditiously.'' In response, the IRS chart says that this ``As of February 21st, 2014, 112 cases in the original backlog, 85 percent, have been closed.''    Commissioner, this is good news, and I understand from your testimony today that this number has gone even higher, to 87 percent. Can you please explain how this expedited review process worked?

11388494076	100000	No. I think what has happened is the subpoena that was delivered to me in February said it wanted all the emails for a set of people. What we have been trying to do is all of those people, you have emails from those people with regard to the determination process pursuant to the search terms that we have been working with. The subpoena now says we would like them all for anything. We have now finally completed, although we are still working on the redaction, all of the production of documents regarding the determination process, which is what the IG report focused on. We have said that that is the first priority we have had. We have never said we are not going to provide you the rest of the documents, and in fact, trying to figure out the most efficient way to do it, we have said we will provide you Lois Lerner emails on everything with regard to examinations, appeals, and the regulatory process as it goes forward.    And I have said when we are done with all of that, if you want to actually get emails, if you want them all, we will give them all to you, but if you want to actually take a more focused investigation on the regulatory process or otherwise, we are happy to work with you to figure how that goes. But in light of this chairman's view, as soon as we can finish the rest of these redactions and go forward, we will provide you volumes of emails, which many of them are going to be irrelevant, which is what I said in Congressman Mica's comment. Not that the materials you have are irrelevant; the ones you are likely to get in volume are irrelevant. And if you want it without any selective process, we will redact them. There are going to be thousands of pages and we are happy to provide them to you, but it is not going to expedite the conclusion of this investigation and, as I say, a significant part of it is going to be irrelevant.

11389598016	111000	I knew that I'd been told there was an issue that no one knew the ramifications of.	So the American people should believe that if they don't have the resources to pay their taxes, they shouldn't pay their taxes, because if the IRS doesn't have the resources, it won't keep records.

11525545116	110000	Well, we talked about, I want the motto to be more than just a motto; ``Do right and feed everyone.'' We have an awesome opportunity in this country as abundant food suppliers for the world, and that doesn't exclude our American citizens too who have less opportunity for food safety and food nutrition. But the fact is that whether it is the P.L. 83-480 program, Food for Peace, McGovern-Dole, or others, I hope that we can see these programs sustained and be able to use the bountiful production of our American producers in order to be a weapon for peace around the world.

11525545181	001101	You represent the Rattlers?	Right. And early on, Congressman Scott spoke about the 1890 institutions, and I happen to represent Florida A&M University that is one of them. And in the early years, there was quite a great deal of interest in agriculture and people returning. In fact, my father-in-law was the farm manager at the university. And it was a great deal of interest to students who were coming out. When I came up, as you say, I was in the FFA, 4-H club, and all of those areas that help you get very acquainted with farm products, growing cattle and poultry, and so forth. But they have been under-funded, and I really feel similar, and I know you have an institution in Georgia, which is right across the line, that we really can enhance that opportunity for students that are going in. You made a statement earlier about, if you don't have these right here, these cell phones and other activities, that is what the young people really need, and the technology that goes along with it.    My question is what can we do when working on the farm bill to make sure that we engage those institutions more with the funding they need to develop more farmers? My father-in-law was at Tuskegee where they did a lot of research with the peanuts and all this other stuff. And so that sets the mould for the future of feeding everyone like you talked about, but those institutions need to get more engaged.

11525545179	101000	One of the ways, what you indicated in your district, what we need to educate people on is that SNAP usage is just not in urban areas, we have a huge rural utilization of SNAP as well in those areas, and the good thing about using those fresh fruits and vegetables you all grow down there is extremely helpful. Food banks, one of the things we can do in food banks is develop a wonderful, progressive food waste program where many of these foods we ought to be ashamed as a nation over our waste of some products, while some people go hungry. Developing programs where we can coordinate with our food banks in these under-served areas with safe food waste issues, policies that make sense, and maybe removing some of the things that don't make sense, maybe one of the areas we can work on together.	I represent northwest Florida, but one of the things that is interesting, within my district, one in every four Floridians have been on SNAP at some point over the last 12 months; twice the national average. And so what level of commitment do you see that we can give to those of us in Congress that have this kind of food insecurity in our area to either enhance the SNAP program? And I was very interested in some of the information that you talked about earlier about education, when someone said about what do people have in their baskets in the grocery store, because growing up in a rural area in a community involved in a lot of farming, all of us as kids, wanted candy and different things in their basket, as a part of what kids actually do.

11388494037	100000	Yes. The criteria for exemption under (c)(4) are complicated because it is a ``facts and circumstance'' determination. The guidance and the new training has provided more guidance to those reviewing as to what is appropriate political advocacy and what is direct political campaign intervention. It is the campaign intervention that if it becomes your primary activity, you, in fact, are not eligible to be a 501(c)(4). There obviously are complicated terms. We provided better guidance and we have also provided improved and new supervision for any determination that is going to be delayed. We also have provided clear lines of authority so if anyone needs advice or additional assistance they can get that automatically and easily.

11388494100	001001	Needless to say, I wasn't around in 1959, when that regulation was given to the IRS.	Now, if I said to my spouse, honey, we have an exclusive relationship, and I mean by that 49 percent, I would probably have problems in my relationship. To her and to me exclusively means just you all the time, 100 percent. So how in the world did we get to a situation where the IRS, on its own, outside of statutory authority, decided to interpret this as primarily? Because, to me, that is part of the problem. Exclusively ought to mean exclusively. And if Congress wants to change that, we should change the law. But I don't remember Congress investing IRS with the authority to actually decide to interpret it radically different, not just kind of a little fudge factor here. This is radically different. And it seems to me therein is the problem, because clearly some of these organizations are not exclusively social welfare agents, I mean, clearly, they are largely designed to be political, partisanly political, that concern the chairman has, overt partisan communication, and I share that concern. And all too many of these organizations hide under the umbrella of social welfare when in fact what they really mean is partisan political activity.

11525545011	110000	Absolutely. I think it is a reasonable request. As you know, I didn't get to the burned areas, but my first trip outside was Kansas City. I heard directly from many of those affected about that. And that is a reasonable request, certainly one that we would consider very, very seriously in a reasonable request effort, because we know that grass doesn't just necessarily grow right back on those kind of issues.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, it is indeed good to see you.    And you mentioned a moment ago on some of the burning issues, let's talk about that for a moment. I think most of my colleagues are aware that in the early part of March this year, a series of wildfires burned over 1 1/2 million acres of land in western Oklahoma, western Kansas, and the Texas Panhandle. And these fires killed thousands of head of cattle, destroyed hundreds and hundreds of miles of fence, impacted countless families, businesses, and it is hard to estimate the impact on the smaller communities.    On the 4th of April, 2017, USDA authorized emergency grazing on Conservation Reserve Program lands located in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas for 90 days. The flexibility to graze on CRP was, and is critical to the survival of many operations throughout my district. And that being said, it will take longer than 90 days to regrow the foliage, rebuild the facilities needed to maintain, contain, and care for the surviving livestock. And last week I, along with Representative Marshall on this Committee, and Representative Thornberry, sent you a letter requesting extension of the emergency grazing authorization past the current 90 day authorization.

11525545039	110000	Absolutely. Again, many of the principles that were included in that, and actually in tandem with the renegotiation of NAFTA, you might see sort of a trilateral TPP. I am just suggesting that, but many of the principles that you all had in these negotiations are still viable, it is just a matter of fine-tuning those in a way that makes sense, I don't think this Administration is not against free trade at all, it really is more concerned to fair trade.	All right, let me move on because we don't get a lot of time here. Obviously, this is a conversation to be continued.    Trade, obviously, is very important. I was disappointed when the President withdrew from all the work that had been done on the TPP.

I would like to see that map that you took to the President and talked about the importance of our trading partners, both in Mexico and Canada.

11525545167	001001	Congressman, you have me under water on your rice production right now.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Perdue, certainly, as another fellow veterinarian, as Mr. Yoho said, we are glad to have you, as a fellow farmer we are glad to have you, and I am sure General Bacon, who is sitting right in front of me, as an Air Force veteran, is glad that he has a fellow Air Force veteran sitting in your chair. We are so happy.    We certainly look for a close relationship. And for a man that, as Governor, stood on the Capitol steps during a severe drought and prayed for rain, and then shortly thereafter addressed record flooding, I definitely want to be closer to you if things go south.    So you have answered certainly most of my questions. The Chairman had one on the cottonseed issue, and that is very near and dear to me in Louisiana. The Ranking Member brought up the State Director of Rural Development and FSA, when they would be filled. And then Mr. Crawford brought up the practical to replant issue, which hit us right between the eyes in Louisiana with the flooding last year. I appreciate you addressing all those issues.    The quick question I do want to ask is that, with furrow irrigation rice, your agency has allowed that to become an insured crop, and in Louisiana we certainly appreciate that. As you know, with the furrow irrigated rice they tend to use the blast resistant seed. And for those here that don't know what that is, it is a fungus that affects rice and just devastates yields. And if they use that seed; that blast resistant seed, production goes up, yield per acre, and certainly water usage goes down, so it is a great thing. My question is when can we expect final approval of this process to take place?	My question is when can we expect final approval of this process to take place?

11525545065	101000	I would be happy to, friend. First of all, let me talk about research just a second because you mentioned that. And you are absolutely right, the reason our producers are so productive today in the 21st century is because of the research and the foundation that has been laid. It is not something that can be cut off and on. And the other thing is the delivery system of that basic and applied research to the field through the extension service has been the wonder of the world, and we see what difference it has made in our productivity, and will continue to need to be as we have to feed nine billion people by 2050.    That is important, but you made a great point, another thing that is just as important is the technology, because you know your producers in middle and south Georgia are using technology for better water usage, better technology for precision agriculture, for monitoring crop needs; whether it is whatever adding, and the telemetry that is needed out there is dependent on wireless technology and WiFi. The other thing sociologically, Congressman, in today's world of connectivity, it might be true in your house with Wells' age, if the water goes off that is kind of a disadvantage, if your lights go off, oh, bummer, if your heat goes off you will get a blanket, but if your WiFi goes off that is a crisis. And that is kind of what happens out there in the world today is we are not sociologically, to Congressman Scott's point, we are not going to keep these young people on the farm attracted there if they don't have the connectivity they are used to when they go to college. They are not going to come back. And it is vitally important. The good news is this is square on the radar scope of the President, as well as the FCC Chairman. I have had conversations with him. He is anxiously awaiting the infrastructure plan where we can ambitiously take rural broadband ubiquitously across the country. As you know, there are places in our home state you can't even get a cell signal.    We have a lot of challenges, but I am convinced of what you hit on, it is the modern-day road, sewer, water of the 21st century is connectivity. And I look forward to promulgating as much of that as we can across the country.	Yes. I am not sure if you would be mending fence or checking cows right now if she hadn't agreed to marry you. You probably wouldn't be here.    Great man, great family, and what you will find from Sonny Perdue is, if he can help you, he will help you, and if he tells you he is going to do something, he is going to do it, and I have always appreciated that from you.    And, Governor, just a couple of quick comments and questions maybe. I was at the USDA research station in Byron this last week. As you know, research is not something that you can simply cut on and off; it is a long-term commitment, it is a long-term investment, and that investment has to be coupled with extension for it to actually get to the fields and help the farmers and our economy. And so they brought up while I was there the hiring freeze, and certainly hope that as we go forward we are able to come out from underneath that hiring freeze, and that you have the flexibility to put the people in the most effective areas with regard to research, and that that partnership will be there with the states, I know under you for the extension to actually get that research to the field.    Your commitment to 4-H, your commitment to FFA is something that also those two organizations are extremely important to rural America, and I know that those organizations will benefit from you being in that position as well.    One of the things that has changed on the farm in the last couple of years, and is changing at an exponential rate, is the use of technology. We know that President Trump will have an infrastructure program that will be put forward. The rural broadband, as you know, we need that, quite honestly, more than we need roads and bridges in many of the counties that I represent. You know from growing up in Houston County, you have metropolitan areas and then just a few miles down the road you have areas like you grew up in, in Bonaire, and I lived in Ashburn for a long time. I tell people I live in Tifton now but I actually live in Chula, Georgia. And so if you could just speak to the rural broadband issue, and any assistance that you believe that the USDA can give us with making sure that the rural broadband is a part of President Trump's infrastructure package? I would appreciate your comments on that.

11525545139	001101	Well, you mentioned several things. Let me think of that and then I can address your final question. But certainly, from the vigilance over foot-and-mouth, as well as any other disease, Congressman, you know that we thought we were done with screwworms, and yet we have these things break out, and very quickly contained, but you have to be vigilant every day.	Secretary Perdue, thanks for being here. I feel a kindred spirit being a fellow veterinarian. And I don't know whether to call you Doc, Governor, or Secretary. If you are like me, you probably prefer Doc. And I look forward to helping you achieve your mission.    The way you opened up, and everything you have said I am in alignment. And it just sounds like you have common sense. I can only feel that comes from working on the south end of a horse or a cow in your past. But what you were talking about, I look forward to helping you achieve your goal of making a realignment of the USDA to make it the most efficient agency in government. And that is such a critical thing, knowing the debt that our country is facing, we have to do more with less, and I look forward to working with you on that.    And you also talked about the USDA stamp, it should be revered and trusted, and I agree, because that stamp around the world stands for the highest quality product that you can get, and it is so important that we protect it.    And several of the things I wanted to talk about were already talked about. Your understanding of FMD, it is music to my ears. There was a point up here where it wasn't talked about much, and we know the threat. We haven't had that here since 1929. If it comes here, it would be devastating. And certainly, we know what happened with BSE with the three cases that were here, and how long it is just now taking us to recover after 15 years. And that was with no depopulation of any of the herds. And certainly, if we had an FMD outbreak, it would be devastating. It would take years and years to recover, not just our cattle herd but our trade.    And as we look forward, I look forward to working with you on the new farm bill to make continued improvements in the cotton program, as was talked, but not at the expense of other crops, i.e., peanuts. I come from north central Florida, and the cottonseed program is something we talked about, to help give diversification to the cotton growers. And that is something that I hope you would consider looking at. But what we know is with these programs, you can't have one at the expense of the other one. And with peanuts, we certainly know within that one program you have discrepancy because you have the people that have generic and/or base acres, and then you have people that have neither, and they are growing peanuts right next to each other. One is at a disadvantage because they don't fall into a program. And we have seen people switch from cotton to grow peanuts because of the farm program. And there are some things that can be fixed in that, and I hope you will look at that. And not to penalize anybody, just to give that, I guess, parity on one peanut field to the next so that those farmers can stay in business, especially the young farmers that we see.    We have several things that we have put together. What I would like to do is having a meeting with you and maybe your staff, and go over some of the things.    And then coming from Florida, we have over 360 specialty crops in Florida. Florida is known for number one in the nation for melons, sweet corn, and citrus. Even with citrus greening, as Mr. Soto brought up, we went from 470 million boxes, we are down to under 70 million boxes. It is something that has to be dealt with, and we look forward to the robust funding that USDA has done.    And I guess one of my asks for you is, the research and development that we are doing is so vitally important, and again, USDA has been great on this, that we take that research and development, because we know one of the cures is probably going to be a GMO tree, to have the USDA help in marketing those products. And that is something I would like to see USDA get involved now to move to where we can start marketing that stuff.    Do you have any thoughts about that?	Do you have any thoughts about that?

11389598095	110000	No. I have done no investigations. I have read the IG's report that said inappropriate criteria were used to identify organizations for review. And the IG had nine recommendations, and we have accepted all of those recommendations.    I think it's important for the public to be confident that, whoever they are, they're going to be treated fairly by the IRS, whether they're Republicans, Democrats, belong to organizations of one kind or another. Wherever they show up, wherever they speak, they should understand they'll be treated fairly. If there's an issue, it's because something in their tax return; if somebody else had that issue, they would get the same response from the IRS.    I think it's critical that the public have that confidence, and we're doing everything we can to restore that confidence.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    Like Mr. Mica, John Koskinen, I have known you well before you came to Congress. Since coming to Congress, I have been impressed, not a little bit, by the confidence you have inspired in Republican and Democratic Presidents alike. It's as if they saved you for jobs that others couldn't do, didn't have the guts to do, or didn't have the integrity to do. You are well-known on both sides of the aisle as the government's most versatile turnaround artist. When an agency is in trouble, turn to John Koskinen.    Therefore, I begin my series of questions simply by offering you an apology. I believe you deserve one. You deserve one because of accusations designed to sacrifice the reputation of a public servant with a spotless reputation, for political advantage, without a scintilla--and I use my words advisedly--of evidence.    It's vile enough to look a man in the face and accuse him of perjury without submitting any evidence. It is much worse when all of the evidence supports the version of the facts of the man you are facing. Whether it is that the Lerner crash occurred well before this investigation began--she must be clairvoyant; whether it's been confirmed by the decriminalization lab, all the evidence is on your side, Mr. Koskinen.    And I want to point out for the record that the line of conspiracy hunting has shifted with the Lerner crash. For the longest time, the line of questioning was about one subject alone. So we've moved from one scapegoat to another. What we've just moved off of, the notion that this was all a conspiracy directed on behalf of the White House, that also without a crumb of evidence. Lacking evidence, the crash provides new fodder.    Just for the record, Mr. Koskinen, have you identified any evidence since you have been Commissioner that IRS employees before you came or now were part of a conspiracy to intentionally target the President's political enemies?

11388494086	100000	I never thought of it that way, but I don't read it that way, no.	Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to see all of his overt partisan political emails. I would like to see if he has emailed relatives, if he has emailed staff members of this committee. I think that would be relevant to putting in context his findings and to determining whether he, in fact, is an objective source of information and analysis. But that is a different matter.    Mr. Koskinen, as I read the Declaration of Independence, it is written largely initially, the first draft, by Thomas Jefferson, but it was subject to an editorial committee. He didn't like that; he thought his words were pretty good. Among those words were Americans were entitled to life, liberty. Now, here the editorial committee did not act. He said and the pursuit of happiness. But it sounds like some people would substitute for that an unfettered and unquestioned access to 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) tax exempt status.

11525545083	000100	Thank you, sir. I haven't told the Chairman yet, but our Chief Economist just said Georgia was number one in cotton.	Absolutely. I share that sentiment. The bill is written to address that very provision, that it is strictly a private transaction with no taxpayer backstop, and that is important to note.    To go back to cotton real quick. I just want to echo the concerns of the Chairman in regards to the problems that we are facing in cotton country. We are behind you by one, we are number three in cotton and Georgia is number two, and the Chairman will claim credit for Texas being number one in cotton production, but we are all in this together. And cotton producers need relief, and they need it yesterday. And, when we start to lose our gin infrastructure, as the old saying goes, ``You can cut down an oak tree in 5 minutes but it takes a long time to grow it back.'' And so as we start to see our ginning infrastructure disappear it is going to have an impact on our rural economies, and in the broader sense on our economy and state in general.

11389598138	001100	At this time, the Inspector General, an independent agency not controlled by us, started an investigation----	Right.    That's why it's so important, getting to what Jim Jordan has said about a special prosecutor, and that's what my question is to you today.    If you are truly a man of integrity and you know the difference between you--you--there's no--that you have--you don't have any evidence that a crime has been committed versus you know no crime has been committed, you have to understand that the whole integrity of your Agency is at risk.    You possibly have people at the IRS who are committing crimes and they're not being held accountable. The only way you can know that is to--by pick up the phone, call the FBI and ask them to come in and do an investigation on the disappearance of these emails.    So my question to you is: Will you call the FBI and ask them to come in and investigate these missing emails that their destruction could possibly have been a crime?

11389598012	100000	What is correct is that each employee is limited to basically now 6,000 emails that they can hold on their email account which is stored on the agency's server.    The reason there is a limitation is the agency does not have servers large enough to sustain the retention of all emails. A decision was made 2 years ago when people looked at that and it was determined it would cost anywhere from $10 million to $30 million to upgrade the system so that, in fact, all emails on the server would be preserved. Because of the budget constraints the agency was operating with 2 years ago, the decision was made not to proceed.	Well, what is correct?	Well, what is correct?

11525545000	100000	Certainly, I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman. Before I get into the answer to that question, you and I have had conversations. I was very pleased that the National Cotton Council came up with a very innovative and creative budget-neutral idea over their program, and it is very disappointing that we were not able to get that done, but we can look for its resolution in the 2018 Farm Bill as you indicated.    Certainly, as I went around visiting, I visited with really 3/4, 75 of your Members on the other side of the House, and trade was on all of their minds really because we are fortunate to live in a nation where we can grow more than we can consume, and that is the essence of trade; doing what we do well, and also it is a noble endeavor to feed the world. Our new motto for USDA is, ``Do right and feed everyone.'' And that is what we want to do; we want to feed the hungry here in the United States, but we want to feed the hungry around the world. And our producers and ranchers have demonstrated a capacity to share and to do that. That is what trade is all about.    In the 2014 Farm Bill you all recognized that, and suggested very strongly for an Under Secretary for Trade. I happen to agree with you. It was not an easy thing to do. There were several components that had to come together, and we are working through those details right now. But we felt it was important because trade was almost number one on everyone's mind that I spoke with, internally, externally, in the Senate, and for those of you who commented as well. We have to sell our way out of this supply/demand situation that are depressing prices in the U.S. now, and that is what we hope to do.    We have seen some early successes of that, and we will continue. The fact is, my opinion is that people do business with people, and I want someone every day that woke up with that on their mind: where can I go to sell United States agricultural products around the world, who is hungry, who will buy, how can we do the deal. Now, our role at USDA is to provide the expertise, the content, to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Ross, and to our new Trade Representative, Mr. Lighthizer, in order to be a triumvirate of sales. The Secretary of Commerce has a broader portfolio than we do at USDA. But that is the blending of trade; you do what you do well, and we sell you what we do well.    I have been very impressed with Secretary Ross and his really sinking his teeth into ag issues and ag products there, and we are very pleased with the progress that we have made so far.    We believe the Secretary of Trade will be on everyone's front door as often as can be. This guy is going to be a million mile flyer around the world to be there in person, because we know that foreign interests love to see you in person. It is an honor for them, for us to come to their doorstep, and call on them and say here is my card, we want to do the deal. And that is important. We can do conference calls, we can do videos, but the presence is important. That person could not do that when they were also charged with the Farm Service Agency of having all these multiple offices around the country dealing with those customer-facing issues every day. I felt very strongly that the segregation of that; having an Under Secretary for Trade, was vitally important to get the job done of selling these bountiful products.	Well, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.    The chair reminds Members they will be recognized for questioning in order of seniority for Members who were here at the start of the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in the order of arrival, and I appreciate Members' understanding.    And with that, I recognize myself for 5 minutes.    Mr. Secretary, again, thanks for being here, and we are looking forward to working with you across the myriad of issues that we have, going forward. As I mentioned in my opening comments, I represent a lot of cotton farmers. I believe we had a very elegant fix to the issue with respect to cotton, to the STAX program, that didn't work. It should have been in the omnibus bill, but our colleagues, particularly two of them in the Senate, refused to see the wisdom of that, and for their own purposes and own benefit, didn't let that happen. Now we are left with the same wreck in cotton. I hope I can count on working with you across whatever tools that we have. Obviously, we think that cottonseed could go under the title I program, and although there could be a lot of challenges with making that happen, we would look forward to working with you either on that or other issues with respect to getting some help to offset what China and India have done to the market, that will allow our producers to compete properly.    I would like to turn now to the Trade Under Secretary that you have announced. Obviously, as authorizers of the 2014 Farm Bill, we thank you very much for seeing the wisdom of that. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you see your Under Secretary working with the other array of trade entities, whether it is the USTR, Department of Commerce, whoever that might be, and the role that that Under Secretary would play, not only in making sure the negotiations go the correct way, but also making sure that the Administration keeps a close eye on enforcement of the various trade things that we have out there.

But you heard one of the principal IRS officials who was involved with Lois Lerner, who came to the chair where you are sitting now and took the Fifth Amendment.

It was pointed out by Mr. Jordan that she concocted it was almost a Hollywood production before the inspector general, May 14th, came out with his report to blame the people in Cincinnati, some rogue IRS employees who gathered around the water cooler and concocted a scheme to again target.

11525545092	000011	I am not sure I can answer that question specifically, other than that I have given my vision, and we are progressing in the protocol, as I understand it, directed by our General Counsel to implement this. I visited with your Chairman and Ranking Member here, the Chairman and Ranking Member of Ag Appropriations to let them know of my plans and to do that. I may not be as attuned to the Federal requirements of permission as they are, but all I know is my heartbeat is to make good and to do well, and to make sure USDA continues to serve the best way. I can't answer the specific process question that you asked.	Yes, we have the legislation, it is just a matter of authorizing the expenditure on that. And I would like to offer an invitation to you to come see the locks and dam system along the Mississippi River. That is the entire western border of my district is the Mississippi, and seeing the locks and dams that were built in the 1930s that really need a lot of attention. But we would love to have you come and visit us, so consider that an invitation.    Quickly shifting gears, yesterday the Joint Economic Committee released a report outlining many of the economic challenges in rural America, which I would like to have entered into the record. But I would also like to acknowledge something that Congresswoman Fudge said earlier, that I am concerned about the Trump Administration budget that calls for a 21 percent cut in USDA, including eliminating Rural Development's water infrastructure programs, and the Rural Business--Cooperative Service. Just a big concern. And that can be echoed, you will probably hear some other questions from my colleagues here. But the reorganization also eliminates the Rural Development mission area entirely, as well as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary, which you have addressed for a moment. But it is my understanding that you have already submitted the reorganization plan to Congress for the mandatory 30 day notification period, however, just today, you sought public comment through a Federal Register notice on the proposal. I was wondering about the formal reorganization plan sent to Congress, why that was presented to Congress before seeking feedback from the impacted stakeholders.

11525545160	110000	Absolutely. Your represented state, it is understood in your poultry industry how much export and how much trade affects that. The good news is we have a poultry ecosystem in this nation; Delaware, Georgia, Arkansas, and across the country, that is just unable to be replicated, from the feed grains and the processing and the growing, and it is a great blessing to do that.    All these tools, we have to have those tools and more available because our producers are going to challenge us. They can grow it, they have demonstrated they can grow it, and the challenge would be to feed that hungry world with trade and export. We need all those tools available.	Okay, great. And then the other question that I had was, I was really pleased to hear you say if they grow it, we want to sell it. And the whole focus on trade really sparked my interest, and given your high priority on enhancing trade opportunities in the U.S. agricultural products, can you share with the Committee your views on FAS programs like the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops, and the MAP, Market Access Program?

This year's budget for 2014 required $300 million just for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but Congress provided us zero.

11525545136	101000	Certainly, our vegetable and our produce section of agriculture, and your people in south Florida and the growers in Florida have maybe been the ones that have not benefitted as much from NAFTA as the rice or the grain, the grain producers, or even dairy in that way. It is a real challenge, but most of the challenge comes from the countercyclical culture of growth. I mean they are lower in the hemisphere than we are, and can grow things different seasonally in that way. But we have to make sure that the safety of those products is just what we insist on in our American producers as well.    And as regarding NAFTA negotiations, my hope and my advocacy will be that we don't go backward in that. But you see, that is one of the areas where we probably can improve our position vis-a-vis Mexico, with regarding fruits and vegetables.	And then on the wage disparity through NAFTA in Mexico, and then also in other trade treaties in Central and South America, how could we help make sure that our agriculture products and fruits and vegetables can be competitive under existing provisions?

11525545015	100000	It is a good question. Mission has no change at all. Personnel, no change. All we are doing is trying to bring the family together where we can communicate better to serving that same customer, whether they are signing up for a farm program, an ARC, PLC, or EQIP or other things there, to come in. I view it as an economy of scale issue. If you have NRCS in one area, and you have FSA, and they have two people in the office and one of them out, our customers are suffering. If you have four people there, that is a little bit better economy of scale to serve people.    We are really talking about the same customers. Now, from a family perspective, how do we communicate, when farmers and ranchers walk into those offices I want to say, whoever greets them, how can we help you today, not, that is not my job. And that is the purpose of the realignment. We will learn better to communicate, we will learn better the real needs of the farm rancher customer that walks in the door, helping to do a farm plan for them. If they are signing up for one thing and we are right there, then we can say, well, let's do an NRCS waterway program that way, and help them be more aware of all the things NRCS can do.    I agree with you, the technology of better water, cleaner water, we are making great strides in. Our farm community is really understanding their stewardship ability, or really opportunity, better than they ever had. They now understand they are responsible for that off-flow off their farms, and they want to do the things. NRCS is critical in enabling them, teaching them, educating them how to do that.    There will be no change in the mission. We are realigning, in a closer family atmosphere where we can have a critical mass to help people better.	It is just the most amazing thing. The potential for that extension would have a tremendous impact upon my constituents.    To touch on one other point that my colleagues have talked about already, in concept, the NRCS, the FSA, and the RMA coordination could improve by being under a single mission area of farm production and conservation. And I am particularly sensitive about these issues because my district was ground zero in the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. And part of why, in the drought of the 1950s, and the drought that we went through in the early part of this decade, things were so dramatically different were all of those conservation efforts properly practiced out there, encouraged by the NRCS and the predecessors of the Soil Conservation Service. How will you ensure that that conservation mission will not be diminished in any way under this new management program, and that the voluntary incentive-based conservation, which is the way we have practiced it since the 1930s, will continue to be the highest priority of the Department?

Any email that existed anywhere, even any hard copy of official records that existed anywhere, has been or will be provided to this committee.	Well, Castillo is now on trial for murdering his wife, but, before that, this committee discovered that he had wrongfully received $500 million in contracts, IT contracts, from the IRS.    And Gregory Roseman took the Fifth. He was one of your employees who helped get him that contract.    When you go home tomorrow or the next day, you might want to see Congresswoman Duckworth asking him how his ankle that he hurt at the prep school feels, because, in fact, he claimed to be a disabled veteran some 27 years later.

11525545077	100000	Congressman, I agree with you. You know that those contracts are set and it can't be changed for this incident, this tragedy that just happened, but the RMA has learned from that, and certainly on some of these dates on practical replant, makes a huge difference for guarding yield production, the quality of seed, the hybrid seed, and other things, the chemicals that are linked with that. You will see, and I will commit to you that you will see some changes in the RMA practical dates, going forward, for the 2018 contract.	It has been just a couple of weeks since we toured some of the devastation in my district. Let me thank you for your responsiveness, your Department's responsiveness, and your personal attention on that issue. I think our 100 year floods are coming a little more frequently than every 100 years. This is our third in 6 years, you saw that yourself. And I guess, as I mentioned before, and has been talked about here, crop insurance is an important component, no question about it, but as it applies to rice the practical to replant provision there has really added more confusion than clarity. And so I am hoping that you can, and I am certain that you will work with us on actually trying to provide some flexibility on that because, as you know, after May 15 it is strictly not practical to replant rice and expect a yield, so having some alternative would be much appreciated?

11525545090	100000	Yes, in the broad answer. Specifically, on the 1,200-foot dam, we will look at that and see. I was at the White House yesterday for an infrastructure meeting, and let me tell you that inland waterways is right at the top of their list over the contribution to the economy. We know how important it is to the ag economy. I was on the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati the other day and saw some of those barge-loading facilities. It is a huge advantage for the U.S. economy, and producers especially. We have other parts in the world in South America that might compete with us production-wise, but they don't have the infrastructure. That wonderful river network that runs through your state and all through the middle of our nation is a vital resource for the world economy. If there is anything we can do, I commit to being a serious advocate for American agriculture. The logistics part is part of that, and the waterways are right at the front of that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Perdue, thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working with you as I represent the northwestern part of the State of Illinois.    I want to start with a quick question, I hope, and then go into something a little more in-depth. To start with, our aging locks and dam system. There is $37 billion in agriculture and food products that flow through the Illinois ports and waterways. Upgrading aging locks and dams on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers is a top priority for the growers that I represent in my region. Congress has authorized these upgrades, but the Administration has to request the funding. And what I would ask of you, if you can answer with a yes or no that would be appreciated, but can we count on you to push this Administration to invest in our water infrastructure, and specifically, will you push for 1,200-foot locks on the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers in the President's infrastructure plan?

11531417065	100000	And just to clarify, we have not stopped that rule. That is not the appropriate way you deal with things.

We have not done any pre-judgment, we have not come to any pre-determined conclusions. We have simply given notice of our intention to do so, which is exactly what the APA implies. And we will go through all of the statutory requirements to do so--notice and comment, so forth, analysis of all the data.    Is it possible that I may come to different conclusions than my predecessor did, looking at the same sets of data? Absolutely. That is the nature of the discretion of the office.

11525545100	100100	Certainly. I would love to comment on that. As you know, we have delayed that rule in order that we can get the facts about that. Beautiful horses, beautiful animals, but we have to balance that with our humane treatment. That is what APHIS does. For the reputation of the wonderful people in the Walking Horse industry, they want the bad actors out as much as anyone does. That is what we hope to have as a regulatory protocol that will ensure how the enforcement operates in that, how that is done, best assures the public that these animals are not being treated inhumanely in order for them to perform. I welcome that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Secretary Perdue. Your presence is greatly appreciated here this morning.    I represent Tennessee's Fourth Congressional District. It is home to the National Tennessee Walking Horse Celebration, with a nationwide economic impact of approximately $3.2 billion. The Tennessee Walking Horse industry directly or indirectly employs over 20,000 people in largely rural areas in farming communities where economic hardship is commonplace. The previous Administration obstructed progress and refused to cooperate with the industry to develop scientific inspection methods to replace the current subjective methods that were prone to error.

11388494119	001011	As I noted, I haven't seen that and can't read it on the chart. I would be delighted to sit down and go over all of those questions with you and with the exempt organizations. All of the TIGTA report didn't blanket say you should never ask questions about this. Thank you for the chart.	Okay. Well, this is put out by the Exempt Organizations Division, same division where all these problems took place over the last three years. It came out, again, just five days after the comment period on the proposed rule ended at the end of February, and I want to just highlight a few of the questions that are asked. So there is a category that says what if the IRS needs more information about your (c)(4) application? New sample questions. So if we could put them up side-by-side.    Now, the first slide are the targeted questions that TIGTA said were inappropriate and that you agree are inappropriate, Judith Kendall agreed are inappropriate. Those are those questions. And now, just five days after the proposed rule comment period ends, you issue a newsletter from the Exempt Organizations Division highlighting the new questions you are going to ask, and I just want to look how similar the two questions are.    Let's just take the second category, whether an officer or director, etcetera, has run or will run for public office. The new question says this: Do you support a candidate for public office who is one of your founders, officers, or board members? It is basically the same. This reminds me of when I was in grade school and the teachers told us you shouldn't plagiarize, so you change a few words and basically plagiarize. This is the same thing.    So here is what I don't understand. If you are trying to comply with the TIGTA report, if the new (c)(4) rule is a way to deal with what the audit said and not as what I believe is a continuation of the project Lois Lerner started, why are you asking the same darn questions?

11525545120	101100	One of the things that has not been talked about in our realignment, reorganization had to do with aligning NRCS and their mission area with FSA. That leaves NRE really with the responsibility of managing our U.S. Forest Service. That is where over 1/3 of the employees in USDA are, and that is, frankly, where some of the biggest challenges have come from. We face litigation, we face NEPA challenges, and other kinds of things in order to utilize the renewable resources on all of our millions of acres out here; northern California and many other states, to do that. Actually, that means jobs as well.    The good news, the fact is a healthy forest is less vulnerable to fire, and you all know that the fire budget has kind of gotten upside down in the Forest Service. We are spending more to fight fires than we are to prevent fires. We hope to get that corrected with your help and reestablished. But I believe, again, a mission area that is focused directly on utilizing the renewable aspects; whether it is deadfall going into biomass, or recovering these trees that might be down, they have a certain period of time that you can harvest them and they would be good lumber, to get ahead of that curve. The challenge is right now so much of that budget is spent in suppression rather than prevention, and we have to get ahead of that. But that is my desire.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Mr. Secretary. It is really great to have you here, and I hope things are going well for you in your transition. And it is also very heartening to hear the colleagues that you know the best; our Georgia colleagues, that have welcomed you here today, and the nonpartisan way which everybody likes working with you. That is a really good indicator compared to some of the things going on around this town.    There are so many issues here, and I am hoping, of course, that we see a rebound in ag commodities at the farm gate there, and then we can see exports are expected to come back up a little bit from a peak of just a few years ago.    We have a lot of issues going on. I have a northern California district, top of the state, and one of the things that we are very, very, concerned about is USDA's oversight of the Forest Service and the need to be much better managing our Federal lands, and moving more into biomass using this over-inventory we have of forest products, so that really need to be managed much better, as we have wildfires every year and we need to incentivize the biomass situation.    So as we work on the Federal land issue, what do you think we can do to grow the markets for biomass, have more economic activity that would be jobs right in our own backyard, for material that needs to be moved right out of our backyard, for private land and Federal land? What do you think we can do more in that area for biomass?	What do you think we can do more in that area for biomass?

11525545128	101000	Well, our desire as parents and grandparents is that the people who take advantage of SNAP would use them for healthy food products. That is the balance: on what level do we want to become a nanny state of directing how, and what, people feed their families. That is the challenge for that. And I probably lean more to the laissez-faire rather than a prescriptive in that area, from a perspective of not wanting, if parents and people who use the SNAP benefits are not doing that at home, I don't know that we can corral them enough with restrictions in SNAP to make them do that. It is a really dicey issue of how we do that. We try to do it through education and through examples, and allowing SNAP to be used at local farmers' markets and making sure in our school program that the free vegetables and fruits are there so our kids can get used to that, and hopefully won't ask Mom and Dad for more of the other than they would healthy things. Someone mentioned earlier, and I wanted to comment on it then, but we have a serious obesity problem in our youth. How do we not only get a good nutrition program, but how do we get a good activity program going as well. All of that is complicated, complex, but it needs to be all of our business about that.	California is number one in medium grade. Thank you for meeting the California folks earlier this week as well too; for rice. We just need a little more help in the exports on that, getting more of that product into Japan. There was a lot of disappointment over the TPP with only opening up another 50,000 tons, which I and about seven other growers could grow that ourselves. That didn't mean a whole lot, so maybe as that comes back around, we can see a little more entry for rice as well as other exports.    Last, I would just like to hear what you think on this. We did hear a little mention of SNAP earlier. We have had a lot of hearings on that during this last year. Very comprehensive. And it keeps coming up the issue of SNAP, which is a program this Committee very strongly supports, but the way it is targeted, and there are a lot of issues with some of the products SNAP is being used for; soda and candy, and things like that, that aren't generally healthy, where the original intent was ag products that come from here. Could you just touch in general on what you feel the direction should be with SNAP, and what kind of products we should be using with that? Thank you.

11525545051	100100	Well, as a veterinarian, I obviously understand the benefit of vaccination, and the fact that we cannot psychologically afford even a foot-and-mouth disease scare here at all. We saw what BSE did to us, and we talked about that earlier, but I want to compliment you on how well you listened in Iowa. I was delighted to be in your district, and to move up from the cows on the farm, a very innovative family farm operation there, up to the APHIS Ames facility. I was very impressed. We talked specifically about vaccine banks there. They are a repository, along with Iowa State, a USDA facility responsible for vaccination protocols as well. I am hopeful, I look at vaccine banks as insurance, and you can't have your house burn down and take out insurance after the fact and have it pay off. You have to have vaccines and you have to have a vaccine availability ahead of the time. I look at it as a wise insurance program.	I want to start out with a retraction of a statement that I made when I first heard of your name coming forward as Secretary of Agriculture, and I will say I thought it was candidly, but I said I hope it is more than about peaches and peanuts. And you came to Iowa 11 days after confirmation, and it was absolutely clear it is much, much more than about peaches and peanuts. And I was gratified to hear many of the things that you had to say there in the heart of my district. And I just wrote down a few of them here from memory. There will be a lot of colloquialisms that will come from our new Secretary of Agriculture, and it adds a lot of flavor to our rural life. For example, I am speaking of the trade that you grow it, we will sell it. I like that bumper sticker, and I have every confidence that will be the policy coming out of the USDA.    And now, one of the other things you said is an oath is stronger even than a contract. That stuck in my mind as the piece of wisdom that a lot of us can apply to our job here every single day. And let's see, the equipment might be a little different but the people are the same. That is another thing that is true all across this country, and it is something we can keep in mind here in this Agriculture Committee. And I will leave out the full story about the cow's tail, but that made it all real, Mr. Secretary.    So I wanted to welcome you to this Agriculture Committee, and I look forward to many discussions that we will have in the future years, and they will be very productive.    One of the things on my mind though as far as an issue is concerned is the fear of foot-and-mouth disease, and it is some of the things that we have been working on for I would say a year and a half or 2 years now in my district and beyond. That is the worst calamity we can imagine as far as biosecurity situation is concerned. I have been doing some work there through Iowa State, and the request that I see across the industry is for a vaccine bank that starts out at about $150 million, and then sells off some of that vaccine and keeps always a fresh supply there. We have another way to go where we can genetically design a vaccine that is going to be cheaper and can be reproduced more quickly.    You went up the road to APHIS and I wasn't able to tag along on that stop, but I wondered if you had any fresh thoughts on FMD and what you might be able to tell this Committee on how you would approach our preparations for potential calamity?

11388494050	100000	Yes.	Again, this committee, it is nice to be here for a while because you see how people try to throw people under the bus. Whether it is the chairman, Mr. Cummings said the case is closed. We started our investigation on June 9th. In May we started. June 9th Mr. Cummings, the ranking member, said it appears the case is closed. And then June 9th--well, he said I see the case is solved. If it were me, I would wrap this case up and move on, to be frank. So he tries to throw the case under the bus. He tried to throw the chairman under the bus. He sent a letter just before that: Your actions over the past three years do not reflect a responsible bipartisan approach to investigations.    Now, he has a constitutional and a House responsibility for investigations and oversight. You have a responsibility to provide us with information.

11525545187	110000	I will commit to you to do that. Certainly, the disappointment in the latest budget issues was kind of a tough slug for us because it limits my opportunities, limits my ability extremely there. But I have committed to the Chairman, you know that he is concerned about that, to do anything we can from the USDA to help relieve that.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Secretary.    I am from Mississippi, and as you are aware, the conditions in cotton country just aren't good right now. And I know that the Chairman started out with that, but farmers in my state are telling me that they can't make it through another year without some relief from somewhere. I can't overemphasize how important this is because, as you know, Secretary, once we lose that cotton infrastructure, you just can't go back and re-get it there. And so I just want to make sure that you are going to explore all the options that you can to work with us, to take care of our cotton farmers so that we don't lose the ability to produce cotton in the future?

11525545035	001100	Certainly, Congressman, I would be happy to answer as best I can. I will admit to you that even when we were in the dairy business, I am not sure I ever understood the Marketing Orders, but I hope to understand it better, going forward.    Back to your original question about diversity of agriculture in California. I had the pleasure this past week of meeting with about 30 of your Western Growers there that comprised California, Arizona, a little bit of Nevada there.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.    Again, welcome, Mr. Secretary, and we look forward to working with you. And you, like myself and many of us here, reflect generations of farm families, and we obviously welcome you to this important effort as we look at reauthorizing the farm bill.    I don't want to repeat what has been discussed already; Farm Credit, crop insurance, cotton, and dairy, but I would like to focus on some California issues specifically.    As the number one agricultural state, the diversity and the breadth and the width, we take great pride in the production in California, and I know you are aware of it. My California colleagues and I here on the dais would like to invite you sooner rather than later to come out to California where we could have a conversation with our farmers, ranchers, dairymen and women, and talk about the complexity of California agriculture.    Speaking of which, we worked very hard in the last farm bill to provide the opportunity for the California dairy industry to participate in the Federal Marketing Order. We have completed the process of the due diligence. USDA is moving on this Milk Marketing Order. I would like to get your thoughts on the current timeline, and can we tackle this final rule before the end of 2017? As you know, the quota issue, if you haven't been briefed on it, is a key part of whether or not the dairy producers will provide a 2/3 vote to join the Federal Marketing Order.

11525545114	101000	Well, again, some of the programs that you all have funded that we have the opportunity to award some grants regarding fresh vegetables and others, it is a healthy food program, FINI is one of them in that area, as well as another one that has to deal with those problems. There is very little money in that, frankly, but we have used pilot projects to understand how we can make sure that those people in the areas where food is not readily available have access, be it local farmers' markets or other ways, and certainly to be able to use their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to access those. We look forward to understanding better how we can even do better in that regard.

11531417077	101000	Actually, nothing could be further from the truth, Congresswoman. We have--actively litigating 25 cases, which includes continuing to litigate things that were filed before I was there. We have only made one dismissal of lawsuits since I have been there, and that was without prejudice. We could talk about that more, if you want to, in another question.	And so it is zero. The Bureau has brought absolutely zero enforcement actions in nearly 5 months since you have been there. And in your testimony you said, ``Our job is to enforce Federal consumer laws.'' But so far there is no evidence that you are enforcing any of the laws.    You have also said that you are taking a ``new approach'' at the Bureau.

11525545007	101100	Well, Congressman, I am just beginning today my fourth week on the job, and while we are waiting for some of the other people to get into that, as you know, on the realignment we are talking about the FSA and NRCS and RMA being collocated and speaking with one voice and one database, frankly. But, again, the opportunity to deal with those kind of issues we have not specifically dealt with. I know a topic of interest and concern to you is CRP, I look forward to visiting with you again. I have not given specific directions. My comments about that is we can have some flexibility in the CRP program, maybe take out some of the least productive areas and use them rather than the whole-field type of philosophy we have had with CRP, give a little more flexibility in that way. With the wildfires we gave some flexibility regarding grazing on some of these areas as well. We want to be flexible while we maintain the integrity of the program, and help to train through FSA and NRCS our farmers to utilize their least productive acres; those that cost the most, and they may even have a better, higher net income if we don't try to plant wall-to-wall.	I believe that you have tasked the Farm Service Agency with looking at a revamp of the CRP program. Did you give them any specific direction or are you just having them look at where things are at?

11525545059	110000	Okay. Those are three important issues, and I would be happy to address all of them, if you don't mind. Again, from an RD perspective, I welcome the accountability. I am an outcome kind of guy. As I understand the current organizational chart, the Under Secretaries report to the Deputy Secretary, and I view the RD portion of this, particularly in limited resources, possibly with an infrastructure program from the Administration and you all. I am not a micromanager but I am a hands-on manager, and this is an area that Secretary Vilsack and I had wonderful conversations about how the potential of USDA has been used across the country in rural communities, both in water systems, both in utilities, and both in community facilities. This is something I guess I jealously wanted to be a part of. When I say elevated, I mean elevated to a portion where that person is going to be sitting close to me, with walk-in privileges over, this is a great opportunity, this is the deal, what do you think about, how can we do better to do that.    I welcome your oversight in the RD portion. The mission is not going to diminish whatsoever. The distribution network that has been developed out here with great people all over the country is not going to be diminished at all. The people in RD are going to report to this Assistant Secretary, who will have direct access to the Secretary, and I consider that an elevation. You can think about it as a nomenclature, but there was in no way a diminishment. If you gave me the opportunity in a corporation to have direct access to the CEO on walk-in privileges over ideas versus a title of a VP, give me that direct access anytime. That is the influence, that is the power, the access. That is the way I view the RD, and I look forward to your accountability in that.    NRCS' mission is not going to change, people aren't going to change. Maybe some locations might change from an economy of scale perspective, as I explained earlier. If we have disparate people and maybe two per office in different places, and we can combine there to have an economy of scale that makes a difference of service to our customers, we may consider doing that. In fact, there are actually preclusions about closing any places. If there is any combination of bringing the family into one house rather than being scattered out in a compound, then we look to have better service in that way.    Third, the advocacy and Secretary Vilsack had made a lot of progress in that. I don't see that diminishing whatsoever.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Secretary.    Mr. Secretary, it was really good to hear you talk about feeding the world. That is very different from the President's budget which has cut almost every single feeding program, or zeroed them out. I am hopeful that you will win.    I am as well concerned, as my Ranking Member, about Rural Development. It is indicated in the reorganization plan that there would no longer be an Under Secretary; it was going to be elevated in some way. I am not sure how that is, except because the Under Secretary reports to you now, so I am not sure what that change is really going to be. But I am concerned, and certainly we will see how it goes as we move forward because, I tell you, you have been really busy in 4 short weeks. This is a major reorganization. I am just going to be watching, as is the rest of the Committee, to see how we progress with that.    Mr. Lucas raised the issue of NRCS, which I am also concerned about. And my first question to you is should we, in the future, look forward to seeing any kind of mergers within the agency or plans to close any of our NRCS offices? And my second question relates to the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, which Congress put in place so that there would be an advocate on behalf of small, beginning, and minority farmers. Last year, the USDA elevated that office to report directly to the Secretary, to you, sir. Your proposed plan now drops it back down to reporting to the Assistant Secretary for Departmental Administration. I just want to know what your thinking was on that?

11525545173	000101	Again, we can get you the answer. The RMA has a board, as you know, that is responsible for setting the actuarial risk tolerances in that, and that is part of USDA, and you and your farmers, your constituents have a right to that answer. I am hoping the answer would be that it is actuarially risk-based, and that is what has been demonstrated. If that is the case then it is hard to argue with that, but we will find an answer out for that as well.	Okay, fair enough. And just one other quick question then, on my sugar farmers, RMA has kicked their crop insurance premiums up about 45 percent. And I have talked to my Farm Bureau people and they don't have any actuarial numbers to explain that increase.

11531417041	101000	I don't remember saying that, Representative Waters, but that certainly does sound like something I would have said.	Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Allow me to repeat for Mr. Mulvaney that you are not and, in my words, should not be construed to suggest the legitimate, lawful acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. So I look forward to the D.C. Circuit Court's swift ruling in the matter. But I will not stand idly by while President Trump's OMB director destroys the Consumer Bureau when harmed consumers need help.    Before I raise some particular questions with you, you have made quite--made it quite known this morning that you don't have to be here and that you don't have to answer questions. I don't know why you think that is so extraordinary. The previous director came here 63 times and not only answered all of our questions, but was badgered by our Chairman. So we certainly expect you to be here, and we certainly expect you to answer our questions.    Mr. Mulvaney, given that the President has wanted to do a big number on Dodd-Frank for his friends on Wall Street, it seems clear that his goals are about trying to install you at the Consumer--what his goals are about trying to install you at the Consumer Bureau.    Now, do you support the mission of the Consumer Bureau? Let's review the record. And maybe you could just answer by yes or no.

11525545029	100000	I would be happy to, Congressman. Again, what we see, I agree with you, I think an insurance program for our producers is a much more palatable safety net program from the public shareholder perspective than direct payments were. I thought you all made a lot of progress in 2014 in transitioning to that area of ARC, PLC, backed up with crop insurance, which put some responsibility on the producers themselves.    Now, that insurance program is not perfect, we have some things we need to readjust. There is, on cotton, for instance, the Chairman is interested in, we have a quality issue that the quality degradation is not right. We hope to adjust that.    The other thing that your producers may have, if they are on ARC, may have a county payment in one county, or might farm in both counties, and it is different and they don't quite understand those differences either as well. There is some fine tuning. Overall, the insurance program has been a great addition. We need to look at more specialty crops, how we can cover more specialty crops in that area and more. We don't want to create a program where our producers are farming for the program, and that happened in the past, and that creates some unnatural market forces that we don't want to have happen. We want a true safety net for those who are doing right, and we don't want people farming for insurance payments either, we want them farming legitimately. But the insurance ought to be utilized when there is a true revenue loss to that producer, be it be price, or be it be production, and how can we design that program.    You all had a great start, and we will look forward to working with you all as we go through the 2014 Farm Bill to make sure that the RMA program is even more effective, going forward. We know that the STAX program was not as helpful to the cotton producers as you all would have hoped, and the dairy program, certainly on some of those issues----	Yes, I hope so too. You might not remember, but about 3 years ago I was asked to make some remarks, it was the National Council of Farmer Co-ops in Hilton Head, and I remember this, after I had made my remarks you came up and introduced yourself and we had a nice little chat. And that is my only interaction so far I have had with you, and it was a good memory so I appreciate that.    I want to mention a couple of things: I want to also thank you for re-evaluating the School Lunch Program, bring some commonsense to that, and I wish somebody, and maybe it will be you, not only talk about the nutrition aspects but let's talk about exercise and activity. School-age kids can burn a lot of calories, and I don't think they are getting the activity and exercise like we used to when we were kids. It is good that we are putting, I guess we only have two percent milk, it is one percent or skim milk in the schools, and just some common sense and reasonableness. And I know my dairy producers will appreciate that in Ohio, we are a big dairy state.    Also I want to thank you too, on the regulatory side the Waters of the United States, some common sense in there, and working with Administrator Pruitt and the EPA to go back to the states, and work on a rule that addresses the Supreme Court decisions.    Also I want to ask a question, first of all, on the crop insurance. Do you have any thoughts how we can make crop insurance better and make it a more essential part of the safety net program, because as a policymaker, when I talk to non-farming public, you talk crop insurance the non-farming public can understand that better. And I would argue in a 10 year budget window, it probably isn't that much cost to the taxpayers, but it really helps in the years when we have a disaster, like a widespread drought. But on the revenue side and the weather side, can you maybe give us your thoughts of what we could do to make crop insurance even better, and it would work for the producers' aspect?

11525545106	101000	As indicated earlier in my testimony, I am very, very pleased with the reaction of your Tennessee State authorities in conjunction with our USDA APHIS people over the containment of the recent outbreak in south central Tennessee. I thought that was the way the system should work. There was very timely action toward depopulation and eliminating the potential spread of that disease, and it has been long enough now that if that had not been effective, we would have seen that. I think the system is working. We learned a lot from 2015, and your State of Alabama and the State of Georgia all collaborated very, very well to make sure that the High-Path AI was contained. I think we are making progress. Can we do better? We can always do better.	All right. And, Secretary, as you know, the nation's poultry industry has been reeling from devastating outbreaks of High-Path Avian Influenza the past several years, most recently which occurred in my district. A GAO report released last week highlighted that USDA has taken significant steps to respond to the crisis, but few ways to determine the effectiveness of these steps.

11525545199	100000	Yes. It is interesting, I gave those guys the same example of that. While we have the wonderful land-grant institutions that Congressman Scott talked about, we have also got some technology schools that are using great processing technology, harvest technology, and preserving technology that make a lot of sense. We are going to look at where our research dollars go. If it makes sense to have a processing, harvesting part of the whole supply chain to benefit agriculture, we will do that. Our example in Georgia, as Congressman Scott knows, is that while our primary land-grants; University of Georgia as well as Fort Valley State, Georgia Tech Engineering School does a lot of work with poultry processing, and how to make that more efficient and better.    Those are the types of things we want to look at to make sure that we use those research dollars wisely, not just maybe in the basic production or applied production sides, but how we get that product in a safe, palatable way to the consumer.	Great. Great. I appreciate that. Thank you.    And briefly, in order to make up for the lack of labor, does the USDA plan on any sort of investment in agriculture technology and ways forward?

We have 90,000 employees and my understanding of the process is that to go through all of those emails, which are millions of emails, to make sure we have not only the outgoing emails, but the incoming emails, is not a matter of a few minutes or a few hours. But, in any event, we have provided for all of those people, or are in the process of providing, all of the information and all of the emails related to the determinations process.	Commissioner, I appreciate that, and my time is limited. I recently pulled all of my emails off of the House computers. It took one person at House Call a part of, a very small part of a morning to gin it up and produce it.

11525545019	001100	Congressman Scott, you have identified some real challenges. You talked about the age issue, but those are particularly significant and disadvantage to opportunities as well.	 Thank you very much.    Mr. Secretary, all of Georgia is very proud of you, and this nation will soon find out why. You are a wonderful, wonderful person, and we are delighted to have you as our Secretary of Agriculture.    Mr. Secretary, we are faced with a very serious national crisis, and that national crisis is the expanding age of our farmers. The average age of our farmers is right at 60 years of age. And we in this Committee have put together a bill to address that. It is House Resolution 51. Let me just tell you, we have been on this mission for over 2 years. It gives us an opportunity to utilize the 19 1890s African American land-grant institutions, which you are familiar with. Fort Valley is a case in Georgia. And you know the whole history of that. We were able to make sure that we had these land-grants.    You have the University of Florida, you have Florida A&M, and Prairie View in Texas, and so forth. The Presidents of these universities have come before this Committee and addressed this need. We have this bill. It is House Resolution 51. What it does is this. It will allow us to utilize these 19 1890s to address this issue and get our younger generation into farming, into agriculture. And more than that, agriculture is new farming, it is far beyond the mule and the plough from past; agriculture is a very sophisticated, technology-driven, science-driven engineering. These African American institutions have curricula applied to address what we refer to as STEM; science, technology, education, and math, at these.    What we want to do with this bill is to change some language in the farm bill which would, one, right now these universities can only spend the money we give them in education, research, and extension. But we want to change and add a fourth area that they could spend it in, which would be student scholarships. We have also set aside and we are working with the CCC, which is the Commodities Credit Corporation, to make sure we have the sufficient funds available. We are offering $1 million for each of the 5 years, for each of the 19 schools. That comes to $95 million. It is something that these universities who have been there in the fire, and have helped to find young people a way out of no options. And we have not exactly been efficient in applying funding, but this would be the area to do it.    I want you to know that this is a bipartisan bill. We have Kevin Cramer, from North Dakota, as the sponsor on the Republican side, myself, several on this Committee; Ms. Fudge, Mr. Lawson, Ms. Adams, another Republican, Mrs. Mia Love out of Utah.    So what I want to ask of you, and I know you have been on 4 weeks, we want to make sure, we sent the bill to your staff, and certainly we want you to really get familiar with it and help us get this bill through our Committee here where it is now, onto the floor and to the Senate, and to the White House. We have been in touch with the White House. We are working with the Senior Legislative Director there, Marc Short. Marc is very familiar with it, and our Blue Dog Democratic meeting he and I talked about it. And President Trump is interested in this type of effort. And, of course, when you read it, if they haven't already informed you, the administration of this particular bill will be through the Department of Agriculture.    So we appreciate you. We can't get it done without your help here. And so I want to ask you for your support, and to work with the Committee and help us get this through the House, through the Senate, and over to President Trump?

11525545134	101100	Regarding the organic issue, certainly, that has become a valuable brand as we see the growth from consumers wanting more of that. The way the oversight works on that from USDA is we authorize or legitimize the certifiers; many times state agencies, to go out and make sure the principles and the processes and the programs that define organic are being carried out. As you might imagine, that is not a 24/7-type inspection. It works much like the Environmental Protection Agency authorizes state EPDs to work in that regard as well.    That is a challenge. Our goal is to have better education of these authorizing certifiers, and to maybe do some auditing out here, not only of the certifiers, but on the ground as well, to do that. We want to jealously guard the legitimate. And there is some legitimate concern regarding cheaters coming into the country with organic labels, that aren't following organic processes. It is a very important responsibility of USDA. We have to leverage that because there is no way for USDA to have enough inspectors on the ground everywhere to certify organics. But in working with our authorized certifiers, and we will just try to do a better job in making sure those people who are violating the rules are not allowed to continue to do that.	Well, we appreciate that.    In addition, we have a large cattle industry in and around my district, including the largest herd in the nation at Deseret Ranch, and we appreciate your commitment to help modernize the North American FMD vaccine bank. I do want to bring to your attention what you may already know, we had a small screwworm outbreak in the Keys, which was a pretty strange place for that to happen. While that is under control, it just highlights that we still have risk to Florida cattle.    And one other thing I know my local cattle ranchers will be sending you an invite to the RAM Rodeo in Osceola County. I encourage you to come along if you can make it, or one of our others. It is part of our tradition there.    The other issue I wanted to bring up is there has been reports that foreign farmers are bringing in fruits and vegetables labeled as organic, that are not organic. And in Florida, we are working on protecting a fruit and vegetable industry that is really struggling under low wages coming through areas like Mexico and Central America.    It is a twofold question. What do you think we can do to assist in making sure organic means just that, particularly from foreign commodities, and what do you think we could do within the NAFTA confines to trigger higher wages under the existing provisions of NAFTA in Mexico and other areas?

11525545197	101000	Certainly. I smile because with your Western Growers the other day, we were talking about produce and melons and those kind of things, and we were talking about this very issue. And I said, well, when I grew up, we were a diversified row crop farm, but he loved truck farming, he loved melons, watermelons, cantaloupes, beans, and sweet corn, but I was his labor right there handling those watermelons, so I know what it takes to harvest them, and I know that it is very, very difficult to get domestic labor to do that any longer. And it is not really a matter of taking American jobs at any cost. We had a situation in Georgia where the legislature felt like they needed to have a tough immigration bill, and it really flushed out a lot of the harvest labor that we had there in Georgia. And there was an example where the Governor said we will let probationers do this, and so they did that for a day or so, but after about half a day the guys said can we go back to prison, because they just weren't willing to do that work. We understand it.    The good news is the President understands as well. This roundtable that we had, I think he understands the contribution that immigrant labor has made to our fields and farms, in processing and other things. We know from poultry processing and other things, there is a lot of immigrant labor.    When I said a way forward, I don't know that I can elaborate on the path today, but I have specifically hired a young woman who is a lawyer from Nebraska, who worked with Farm Bureau, whose expertise is in the farm labor. And what we want to do is to give to my boss in the Administration an opportunity and to thread the needle over this issue of how we utilize immigrant labor in this nation.    I believe the heart is there, the how-to and the process right now is what we have to figure out, but I can tell you, trade, labor, regulations are job one, two, and three.	Once again, my name is Jimmy Panetta. I represent the Central Coast of California; what my colleagues know as, based on my advertising, and I will tell you, the salad bowl of the world. We have plenty of specialty crops in that area. And this point I will be so brash as to personally invite you out to the Central Coast of California so that you can reinforce your understanding of specialty crops, and also what it takes to harvest these specialty crops. And what I mean by that, and what you know and what you have heard, is labor, and that has been an issue. Obviously, California, like Georgia, experienced some droughts, especially one in the past few years, excluding this year, thankfully. But even during that drought, the number one issue for our people in agriculture, especially on the Central Coast, was immigration, was labor force. And now, based on the political atmosphere in this country, based on the changing socioeconomic atmosphere in Mexico and southern Central America, and based on Congress' failure to do anything on immigration since 1986, it is not just an issue, it is an emergency. And I tell you, every single person that I speak to in agriculture, farmer to farmworker, they will tell you that the lack of labor force is the number one most pressing issue that they are facing right now, and it is an emergency situation.    I appreciate your statement during confirmation to Senator Gillibrand when she asked if you had a commitment to making sure that producers have access to farmworkers, and your response was, ``I will commit that to you, Senator.'' And then right away today, to Representative Costa, you said, ``I will help to provide a way forward when it comes to immigration and making sure that there is labor there to help us harvest our crops.''

11389598067	100000	That's correct. All the emails before June----	Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.    I have known the Commissioner for many years, and I know him to be a good public servant. I'm a little bit baffled.    I know, John, I think that you're probably in a position of the guy at the end of the parade with the broom and shovel here and in a very difficult situation.    Let me, if I can, just take people back to the history of this, and to you, Commissioner. This targeting began sometime in March or April of 2010. In June of 2010, Chairman Issa alerted IRS and it made an inquiry. In February of 2011, Lois Lerner sent an email to IRS employees stating that the Tea Party is a very dangerous matter.    Then the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction, in June of 2011, June 3rd, Dave Camp, who you spent time with recently, sent a letter to IRS the heat--it looks like the heat really started to come on at that point.    Now, an entire administration and one of the biggest scandals in government was back during Watergate when, what, 18 minutes of tape was lost. And somehow, between June 3rd and June 13th, Lois Lerner's hard drive crashes and is gone in 10 days.

11531417063	101000	We are going to do, I think--and again, when I say a better job, I want to make it very clear that I was not there beforehand. So when you hear me say that we are going to do things differently, I don't want to automatically imply that the staff was not doing a good job before I got there. In fact, my experience has been that nothing could be further from the truth. I have been very impressed with the quality of the work that the staff has been asked to do.    The question is what have they been asked to do by their leadership. And one of the things I have asked the staff to pay closer attention to, moving forward, is the cost benefit analysis. I was, quite frankly, surprised, Mr. Luetkemeyer, by the amount of qualitative cost benefit analysis that was done. In fact, my background is in numbers, economics, commerce, finance. I didn't realize you could do qualitative cost benefit analysis. I thought cost benefit analysis was supposed to be quantitative.    I have come to accept, I think, that a certain amount of qualitative analysis is part--can be a valuable part of any analysis. But we are going to do a better job on quantitative analysis.    So, to your point, we are going to take a close look at how consumers would be affected, in terms of services that would not be available to them, the impact on the markets, the impacts on availability of credit, the impacts of availability of capital, and the flow of capital to small businesses and to individuals.

But you cannot say what I've asked you, that no crime has been committed.    So let's go to Lois Lerner. She came before this committee and, under--while she was placed under oath, she evoked the Fifth because she indicated that she wanted to assert those rights, albeit that she did that incorrectly, because she had fear of prosecution. Let's say that again. Prosecution. Fear of criminal prosecution.    Now, you can't testify today that Lois Lerner has no need for a fear of criminal prosecution because you can't testify that Lois Lerner didn't commit a crime.    Now, here's what I'm concerned about, since you are a man who is placed before us with integrity.    If in the process of these emails being destroyed there were those in your Agency that knew that it was a possibility that a crime was committed, then they committed a crime because destruction of evidence of a crime is, in fact, a crime.

11525545112	100000	Well, when it comes to food safety, Congressman, there is a zero tolerance policy, and that is what Americans expect, that is what we have come to benefit from, and the veterinary profession is intimately involved in that. When I graduated from veterinary school in 1971, I had volunteered for an assignment in the United States Air Force. I don't know that I realized that that would be a food safety and public health mission there. When I served in Ohio it was food safety and public health, and I learned a broad perspective of how important that was. The food safety industry and profession had not matured at that time in the 1970s, but I learned a lot about it, was trained in that area.    We have great veterinarians in our inspection services all over. And while you are correct, your veterinary school in Pennsylvania is one of the renowned ones, along with Iowa State, Kansas, and others, along with my alma mater, University of Georgia, have done a great job putting out professionals who are part of that food safety network. We have also got great career professionals in USDA under the guidance of veterinarians who are doing great work in that.    Much of the foodborne illness you see happens after that in the supply chain, delivery, in restaurants, and others, but we are committed to a zero tolerance policy to make sure that the food that Americans feed their families are safe.

11389598047	100000	That's an email that has been found and been produced, yes.	Now, Commissioner Koskinen, last week, many Members of Congress, including our own chairman, suggested that Lois Lerner intentionally crashed her computer to destroy emails. But, last Friday, you testified about the facts. You provided Congress with evidence from 2011, contemporaneous, by the way, emails showing exactly the opposite and that this was a technological problem. Since some Members of Congress are still pushing this accusation, I want to walk through these emails.    And let me ask staff to put up the slides.    On July 19th, 2011, Lois Lerner emailed Associate Chief Information Officer at the IRS for help in recovering her hard drive. And it says, ``I'm taking advantage of your offer to try and recapture my lost personal files. My computer skills are pretty basic, so nothing fancy. But there were some documents in the files that are irreplaceable. Whatever you can do to help is greatly appreciated.''    Commissioner Koskinen, is that right? Is that accurate?	Is that accurate?

11525545203	101000	I will, Congressman. Again, my mantra has been sound science, fact-based, data-driven, customer-focused decisions. And that is what we hope to do. That is a balance, obviously. As you know, today, we have used science in a way that sometimes comes from an ideological perspective, and the sound science definition is in the eye of the beholder. We have to make sure at USDA we have an agenda-less investigation, and things that come out without a predetermined conclusion over our scientific discovery that help us lead. I am not smart enough to create, intuitively, programs and policies without data, without science, without facts to do that. I agree with you.    The other part about that, when you talked about the agency that promulgated that, Secretary Price and I served in the state Senate. We have already talked about some interagency working between delineating FDA's role and USDA's role in some of these areas. The good news about the President's interagency task force over rural prosperity was, we get to talk about with different people how your rules affect my people, and how my rules may affect your people in that regard. We want to collaborate in a holistic approach to government, I think like I have not seen before; that is the Secretary of the Interior, FDA, HHS, Commerce and Energy, and those working together, the EPA Administrator. I told Scott Pruitt, I said my guys are much more excited about you than they are me, those folks are interagency.	Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Secretary, I am so glad to see that you are now the Agriculture Secretary. And everything I have read about you was excellent, and just hearing your testimony is really reassuring to me. I have always said it should be a prerequisite that the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture should have a farm background. I know you have an excellent track record in farming and agribusiness, and I am looking forward to working with you.    I represent 35 counties in Kentucky, 35 rural counties, and there are six Congressional districts in Kentucky. And when you look at the total agriculture sales in Kentucky, the overwhelming majority of those sales come from the First Congressional District of Kentucky. We have poultry, we have beef cattle, corn, wheat, horses, and a lot of tobacco. Tobacco is still a very important crop in Kentucky.    My question is, in many instances the previous Administration promulgated regs that were unachievable. For example, the FDA pushed forward a proposed rule at the very last minute that would limit NNN, I am going to say it, N-Nitrosonornicotine, in smokeless tobacco to levels lower than growers could achieve. Will you commit to use sound, scientific data in rulemaking, and work with farmers and ranchers in drafting regulations to ensure that they are realistic and practical?

11389598122	000001	I'm not sure I understand that question.    I'm in charge of the Agency, I'm responsible for its activities, and I'm accountable for its activities.	Mr. Koskinen, you are touted as a man of integrity, and I've even heard you say it about yourself on television. So I'm going to ask you to use that integrity to help me understand a few things that have become confusing to me.    Now, you said that you want to restore confidence to the Agency, and I have no question to question that. I have no basis upon which to think that that isn't your goal.    But you have to understand that this discussion of the missing emails goes right to the heart of the issue of confidence and of the issue of your ability to do that and of your integrity.    So let's start first with just some general concept of ethics, back to your integrity.    Now, you agree, as Commissioner, that you can't both be the manager of the Agency, the investigator of the Agency, judge, jury, and prosecutor of matters that are being undertaken under and by the Agency. Right?    There's inherent conflict and bias in those positions. You, by basic concepts of an ethics with integrity, can't fill all of those. Correct?	Correct?
